Stuff To Do When You Move Prod to Stg (same formula for prod to dev) 

Modules to Configure:

Varnish - need to update the “Varnish Control Terminal” to “www2-stg-cache:6082” and update the “Varnish Control Key” to the contents of “www2-stg:/etc/varnish/secret”

Database Log - turn this on

Stage File Proxy - turn this on and set the domain to point at the prod environment, which by the time someone looks at this next will probably be “http://www.calacademy.org”

Reconfigure Robots Txt module to disallow all on stg (since stg still in DMZ)
