Project Description 
          On January 7, The California Academy of Sciences will officially embark on the most massive move ever undertaken by a museum, transporting millions of priceless treasures across the city of San Francisco into their new home in Golden Gate Park. More than 20 million scientific specimens collected over the past 150 years from around the world will make the monumental move, along with penguins, parrots, pythons, piranhas, and thousands of other live aquarium animals. These specimens and animals, which currently reside at the Academy's temporary facility in downtown San Francisco, will form the backbone of the new Academy's research, education, and exhibition programs when the new museum opens in Golden Gate Park in the Fall of 2008.

<p> SAN FRANCISCO (January 3, 2008) — On January 7, The California Academy of Sciences will officially embark on the most massive move ever undertaken by a museum, transporting millions of priceless treasures across the city of San Francisco into their new home in Golden Gate Park. More than 20 million scientific specimens collected over the past 150 years from around the world will make the monumental move, along with penguins, parrots, pythons, piranhas, and thousands of other live aquarium animals. These specimens and animals, which currently reside at the Academy's temporary facility in downtown San Francisco, will form the backbone of the new Academy's research, education, and exhibition programs when the new museum opens in Golden Gate Park in the Fall of 2008. </p>
<p> A parade of unprecedented proportions, the Academy's “Great Migration” will take approximately eight months from start to finish. Participants will range from two million fish specimens stored in jars of alcohol (including some species that are now extinct) to Methuselah, the Australian lungfish—the oldest living fish in captivity. The packing and moving tactics that will be employed are unique and highly customized. In the coming months, a colony of African penguins will be loaded into dog kennels lined with recycled newspaper pellets, a 58 year-old alligator gar will be lifted by stretcher into a transport tank, live snakes will be slipped into soft canvas bags, and 1,500 colonies of living coral will be individually packed in plastic bags full of carefully regulated water. Thousands of Galapagos finch study skins (the group studied by Darwin) and over 10,000 sets of bird nests and eggs will be stabilized with bubble wrap, millions of pressed and dried plant specimens will be tied into secure bundles, and a 1,350-pound quartz cluster will be hoisted into a moving van. Among the most delicate participants in the migration, more than 700,000 pinned butterflies and moths will be stabilized with additional pins and handled with extra care to prevent their wings from being jostled. Rather than cardboard boxes, reusable plastic bins that can be securely stacked on top of one another will be used to complete the move as efficiently and “greenly” as possible. For the first six months of the move, transport trucks will be loaded and sent to the Academy's new building in Golden Gate Park five times a day, five days a week. The aquarium's live animal transport will continue on a more sporadic basis for another two months. </p>
<p> The Academy's specimen collections are an invaluable research tool for scientists around the world, collectively serving as an expansive reference library of Earth's life forms. The collections contain a number of specimens, such as the Elephant bird and the Falkland Island fox, which are now extinct. These specimens preserve some of the only genetic and anatomical information that remains about many extinct species. Perhaps more importantly, the collections allow scientists to create biodiversity maps, highlighting those ecosystems and environments that are most critically in need of protection if we wish to avoid future extinctions. Data embedded in the Academy's specimen collections also allow scientists to track species ranges and environmental pollutants over time, as well as evolutionary pathways and climate change patterns. Once these specimens are nested into their new high-density, compactable storage cabinets, they will take up about 360,000 cubic feet—the equivalent of a 10-foot-wide by nine-foot tall strip of cabinets that runs the length of over 13 football fields. </p>
<p> The live animals that will participate in the move will fill the new Academy's aquarium displays, natural history exhibits, and living rainforest dome, bringing new life to timely topics such as evolution and sustainability. Representing over 900 separate species, these animals will comprise one of the most diverse assemblages of live animals at any museum or aquarium around the world.</p>
<p>About the new California Academy of Sciences Building </p>
<p>One of the world's most innovative museum building programs, the record-setting new California Academy of Sciences building will blend seamlessly into San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Expected to earn a LEED Platinum certification, the new Academy will be topped with a 2.5-acre living roof and will employ a wide range of energy-saving materials and technologies. Designed by Pritzker Prize winner Renzo Piano, the new building will stand as an embodiment of the Academy's mission to explore, explain and protect the natural world. With interpretive signage about its green features and a roof-top observation deck, the building will also serve as an exhibit in and of itself. Construction on the exterior of the new facility, which began in September of 2005, was completed at the end of October 2007. The Academy received the keys to the building on November 1, and has now begun the process of building out the exhibits and moving its collection of live animals and research specimens into their new home. </p>

The Cosmic Seeds of Life <br>Lecture by Dr. Sun Kwok, University of Hong Kong<br>
For the last fifty years, scientists have believed that life on Earth began with simple inorganic molecules that, under proper conditions, gradually evolved into complex organic compounds and eventually life. Recently, through observations with space-based infrared telescopes, astronomers have discovered that old stars can synthesize organic compounds over relatively short time scales. Stellar winds then spread these organic materials throughout the Galaxy, including our primordial solar system. <em> 7:30 pm; $4; Jewish Community Center, 3200 California Street, San Francisco.

			<div id="pr_body">  <p> SAN FRANCISCO (May 30, 2008) --- When the new California Academy of Sciences opens in San Francisco on September 27, 2008, it will push the boundaries of the traditional museum exhibit. To tell stories about the history and future of life on Earth, the Academy will rely not only on traditional displays and exhibit text, but also on thousands of live animals, opportunities to meet practicing scientists, revolutionary green architecture, and an integrated approach to its café and restaurant. The casual Academy Café and the full service Moss Room will be treated like exhibits, encouraging visitors to ponder the vital relationship between food and culture and to consider the benefits of eating sustainably. Both menus will highlight local, seasonal, organic produce; sustainable seafood that adheres to the Academy’s Seafood Watch standards; and locally-sourced, hormone-free meats. Additionally, featured menu offerings will be created to complement temporary exhibits and special programming elsewhere in the museum. </p> <p>Renowned chefs Loretta Keller and Charles Phan will partner on the innovative new café and restaurant. The two San Francisco-based chefs were inspired to work together for a simple reason: “Charles was always craving my food, and I was always craving his,” says Keller. “We were constantly eating in each other’s restaurants, and we realized that we share the same approach to food—it’s all about soul and story.” When they heard about the opportunity to create a café and restaurant for the new California Academy of Sciences, they were excited by the possibility to share this approach with a wider audience. “It’s an amazing opportunity to reach people from all over the world, and to change the way people eat” says Phan. “Sustainable, organic food is a must today, especially in a museum like the Academy. But we also want to preserve culture. We want to create an educational experience in which the food has a story.” </p> <p>The Academy Café will offer healthy, kid-friendly, multicultural food that reflects many of the cultural influences in the Bay Area. It will offer a wide variety of dishes that feature fresh, local ingredients, showcasing the fruits of California’s rich farmland for the Academy’s international visitors. While the menu will change frequently, the soups might include such offerings as tortilla soup with fresh tomato and avocado, winter squash soup with toasted pumpkin seeds, and Hanoi beef noodle soup. Additional offerings will include sandwiches and paninis, slow-cooked stews and porridges, spring rolls and salads, steamed buns and vegetables, pastas, tacos, and “from the garden” selections. Several favorites from Phan’s Slanted Door restaurant will appear on the menu, including the grapefruit and jicama salad, chicken claypot, and steamed pork buns. A few of Keller’s most popular dishes from COCO5OO will also make appearances, including beef cheek mole tacos and fresh ricotta ravioli. Rather than creating a designated “kids menu,” the chefs have incorporated items with wide appeal into the standard menu, including their takes on chicken noodle soup, spaghettini and meatballs, and macaroni and cheese. </p> <p>The Moss Room will be open for lunch daily and dinner Wednesday through Sunday, serving dishes inspired by the bounty of the Bay Area in an elegant setting. The room takes its name from a large wall with living moss that will rise from an aquarium tank filled with Southeast Asian river fishes. The moss will draw nutrients from the fish, while cleaning and recycling the water in the tank below. The Moss Room menu will change weekly and will feature house-made pates and terrines, salads of local organic lettuces and produce, house-made pastas, earthenware-baked dishes, and other house specialties. In keeping with the kitchen offerings, the beverage program will feature small-production, organic, bio-dynamic wines and spirits. </p> <p>In addition to The Academy Café and The Moss Room, Keller and Phan are also creating three portable food carts that will offer quick fare in the gardens on either side of the museum and inside the central piazza. Cart offerings will include steamed buns, homemade hotdogs, tacos, organic milkshakes, and cappuccinos. </p> <p>Sustainable practices in the café and restaurant will extend beyond sourcing local, sustainable ingredients. Unnecessary packaging and materials will be avoided. Water and energy efficient foodservice appliances will be installed. Both venues will use washable, rather than disposable, dishware and utensils.

Leslie Simson, a San Francisco-born mining engineer, donated $300,000 for its construction. He also led a 1930 expedition to collect specimens for the hall, believing in the educational value and importance of creating a record of Africa ’s vanishing wildlife. Frank Tose, then Chief of Exhibits at the Academy, sketched and photographed the actual localities where the specimens were collected to ensure that each diorama would be true to life. <br><br></p> 		           <b>Saving the Past</b>             <p class="MsoPlainText">While it was not possible to save the original African Hall in its entirety, the outer two limestone walls of the hall were conserved for aesthetic and historical value; they are the only structures from the old Academy that are present in the new building. In order to faithfully recreate the dioramas, extensive photographs, video footage, and paint samples were taken in the old African Hall before demolition began in 2004.  The mounted animals were saved, cleaned, and repaired for re-use.  Ceiling tiles and other architectural details were recreated from casts of the originals.    </p>                         <b>Enhancing the New</b>                <p class="MsoPlainText">Although much of Tusher African Hall looks identical to the original, the visitor experience is enhanced with some surprising new elements.&nbsp; Five of the dioramas contain live animals.

However, when these same respondents were asked which nation was most responsible for global warming, they named five other countries more frequently than the United States. (In reality, the United States has been the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide for decades, and even today remains in the top two.) In an effort to address such misconceptions, and to engage visitors in one of the most important scientific topics of our time, the California Academy of Sciences will unveil the exhibit Altered State: Climate Change in California as part of its grand reopening on September 27.</p> <p>Altered State uses California as a case study to explore the science of climate change, the effects we might expect to see in our own backyard, and the steps that can be taken to mitigate these dramatic changes. California is one of the world’s 34 “biodiversity hotspots,” and it harbors a diverse array of life. Shaped by the state’s unique geology, climate, and ecosystems, many of the native plants and animals cannot be found anywhere else on Earth—and many are now threatened due to the local impacts of global climate change.</p> <p>“Climate change is the largest and most significant problem that we will face in the foreseeable future,” says Dr. Peter Roopnarine, Academy scientist and lead curator for the exhibit. “It’s something we should all care about, because we stand to lose a lot—especially here in California where our natural resources are so rich and beautiful. Fortunately, California is in a unique position to study and address the problem. The state is one of the largest economies in the world, so the actions we take here will make a difference. It also has a long tradition of innovation and a wealth of technological and scientific expertise.”</p> <p>The Altered State exhibit is divided into four free-standing “modules,” each of which covers a different aspect of climate change at both the local and global levels: changing oceans, melting snow and ice, hotter and drier climates, and endangered and extinct organisms. A variety of exhibit elements brings these modules to life, including multimedia displays, interactive stations, live animals, and dozens of specimens from the Academy’s unrivaled collection of California plants, animals, fossils, and minerals. </p> <p>Suspended from the ceiling above the “changing oceans” module is an 87-foot, 6000-pound blue whale skeleton—the largest animal on Earth. Part of the Academy’s collections since 1915, this skeleton is a reminder of the stunning biodiversity that exists in California’s waters. Also on display in this module is a live tidewater goby, a fish that is endemic to California’s wetlands but is now threatened by habitat loss. Other topics in this area include rising sea levels, ocean acidification, hurricanes, and changes in circulation and productivity. </p> <p>In the “melting snow and ice” module, visitors can find a display of live Nebria beetles, which inhabit the snowfields of the Sierra Nevadas. In recent years, scientists have had to search for them at higher altitudes because their icy habitats are shrinking. This module also has an interactive projection room that demonstrates how disappearing Arctic ice causes the remaining ice on Earth to melt even faster. By moving their arms and bodies, visitors can block virtual sunlight from melting ice floes on a screen. As a result, ice floes connect and allow a mother polar bear to reunite with her cub. </p> <p>In the “hotter and drier” module, a live rattlesnake slithers and serves as an ambassador for California’s desert habitats. Topics addressed here include heat waves in Europe, wildfires in California, and the impact of climate change on the state’s delicate redwood forests and chaparral regions. </p> <p>The final module focuses on “endangered and extinct” organisms. Here, a full-size cast skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex reminds visitors of Earth’s last global extinction, 65 million years ago, while a saber-tooth cat skull and mammoth tusk represent more recent extinction events. Humans are widely regarded as the cause of the current mass extinction. Mounted specimens of Monarch, California’s last grizzly bear, and a condor provide evidence for this—since the 1849 Gold Rush brought an influx of humans to the state, grizzly bears have become locally extinct in California, and condors have become endangered. </p> <p>While the reality of climate change may be daunting, one final area in the Altered State exhibit empowers visitors to fight back. Anchored in the center of the exhibit, the “Arena for Engagement” encourages visitors to take action, dream of solutions, assess their personal carbon consumption, and learn surprising facts about their everyday activities. They can videotape themselves making a pledge to reduce their carbon footprints, and then email the video to their friends; submit ideas for alternative energy technologies on a communal bulletin board; use a scale to assess their carbon consumption based on how many miles they drive, how much energy they use at home, and more; and select from a “menu” of everyday food items and learn the total carbon cost of producing them. Content for the Arena for Engagement was drawn in part from Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E), an active leader in the field of renewable energy solutions and provider of some of the nation’s cleanest energy. </p> <p>PG&amp;E’s support of Altered State is part of the utility’s charitable $1.5 million, four-year collaboration with the Academy. In addition to advising exhibit designers on energy-related topics and providing an alternative energy website for visitors to browse in the exhibit, PG&amp;E contributed content specifically about their solar thermal energy projects. Solar thermal energy uses sunlight to heat water, create steam and spin turbines, generating “clean” electricity when demand is highest in California—during the afternoon hours. </p> <p>“Climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution and education is the critical foundation that empowers people to take action,” said Nancy McFadden, senior vice president of public affairs for PG&amp;E. “PG&amp;E is honored to support the new California Academy of Sciences, especially as the Academy takes on the important mission of inspiring all of us to create a more sustainable environment.”</p> <p>Surrounding Altered State are plenty of opportunities to learn more about California and sustainable practices. Nearby, seawater crashes against the shores of a 100,000-gallon California Coast tank, home to hundreds of local fish and marine invertebrates. Adjacent to Altered State is Building Green, a wall of images and panels highlighting the sustainable design features of the new Academy. Finally, visitors can enter the gardens next to Altered State and gaze at Where the Land Meets the Sea, a wireframe sculpture by Maya Lin depicting the topography of San Francisco Bay.</p> <p><b>Support for Altered State: Climate Change in California <br></b>Altered State is sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the lead sponsor for the exhibit, as well as the Susie Tompkins Buell Foundation, 11th Hour Project, and California Cultural and Historical Endowment. The James Irvine Foundation provided support for the Arena for Engagement. </p>

SCIENTISTS DEVELOP NEW MODEL FOR PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY
<br>Based on robust quantitative analysis, Academy entomologist Brian Fisher and an <br>
international team of collaborators create a new conservation map for Madagascar 
<br>Proposed protected areas will preserve the maximum number of species
<br><p><b>SAN FRANCISCO (April 7, 2008)</b> — In an era of climate change, pollution, and rapid habitat loss, it's all too easy for doom and gloom to prevail when discussing conservation issues. However, armed with the right information, it is still possible to create conservation success stories. That is just what Academy entomologist Brian Fisher and a team of international collaborators are well on their way to doing in Madagascar, an island nation off the coast of Africa that is considered to be one of the most significant biodiversity hotspots in the world. Using distribution data from 2,315 species of ants, butterflies, frogs, geckos, lemurs, and plants found only in Madagascar, the team has proposed locations for new protected areas that will preserve the maximum number of species. This remarkable new analysis provides a road map for making conservation decisions in other biodiversity hotspots around the world. Their results are described in the April 11 issue of the journal Science.</p>

<p>	"We are the first generation to understand the impending demise of natural habitats," says Fisher, Associate Curator of Entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, "and we are the last generation that will have the ability to do something meaningful about it. This type of multi-taxon analysis will be critical to our efforts to preserve biodiversity for future generations."</p>

<p>	An important opportunity currently exists to influence conservation decisions in Madagascar, since the government announced in 2003 that it planned to triple the country's protected-area network from about 5 million to 15 million acres (20,234-60,700 square kilometers), or about 10 percent of the island's total land surface, by the end of 2008. It would be tempting to select additional conservation areas based on the distribution of large, charismatic mammals, such as the country's iconic lemurs. However, Fisher and his colleagues found that choosing conservation areas based on a single taxon would result in a reserve network that failed to protect between 16 to 39 percent of the species in their study. Conversely, by running a complex algorithm that took into account distribution data from six different taxa, they were able to recommend protected areas that would preserve all 2,315 species in their study.</p>

<p>"Insects represent the bulk of terrestrial animal diversity but are often overlooked in conservation assessments," says Fisher. "This study is unique in including a wide breath of animals and plants in its conservation analysis."</p>

<p>	This type of complex analysis has not been possible in the past because of a lack of data on species distributions and computational constraints on achieving high-resolution assessments over large geographic areas. To overcome these obstacles, Fisher and his colleagues spent nearly a decade amassing data on species distribution in Madagascar. They also worked with computer scientists at AT&amp;T and Finland's Helsinki University to develop the necessary software to run their analysis. Before running their analysis, they placed additional weight on species with the highest risk of extinction—those with narrow ranges and those that have experienced a substantial loss of habitat.</p>

<p>	To date, Madagascar has established protected areas that total 6.3 percent of the country's land mass, with an additional 3.7 percent left to be assigned. The recent analysis run by Fisher and his colleagues indicates that the current protected areas encompass about 70 percent of the species in their study. Based on the results of their computations, they have suggested locations for the remaining reserve areas that will extend protection to all 2,315 species in the study. Their proposed solution also creates additional coverage for the most vulnerable species on their list.</p>

<p>	The team's results provide some fresh insights into conservation decisions in Madagascar. For instance, they found that many endemic species currently lack protection because they live in areas with relatively low forest cover. Without the benefit of robust data analysis, these areas have historically been neglected in favor of protecting large forest blocks.</p>

<p>	Although conservation areas in Madagascar must be identified by the end of 
2008, final refinement and legal designation will not be completed until 2012. Therefore, Fisher and his colleagues will be able to refine their recommendations as new species are discovered, or as proposed protected areas are rejected or destroyed. This quantitative, practical approach to conservation decision-making is a valuable model for biodiversity hotspots in other parts of the world.</p>
<br>Dr. Brian L. Fisher
<p>Brian L. Fisher, Associate Curator of Entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, is an ant systematist who specializes in the large-scale discovery, description and naming of African and Malagasy ants. In the past few years, he has discovered over 800 new species of ants in Madagascar alone, including the Madagascar Dracula Ant—a find that is helping scientists to understand the evolution of ants from wasps. Fisher also maps diversity patterns and uses them to instruct land management and conservation decisions. His inventory work in Africa and Madagascar demonstrates the feasibility and challenges of conducting global biodiversity inventories. He is currently developing technologies for collaborative taxonomy, which will accelerate the process of identification and description of new species with products accessible across a broad community of users (see www.antweb.org).  He also has particular interest in the evolution of the early lineages of ants and is dedicated to instructing the next generation of ant systematists. Fisher is the author of two books published in 2007: Save an ant, Save a Planet and Ants of North America.</p>
<br>About Madagascar
<p>Madagascar is an island nation located about 200 miles off the coast of eastern Africa. Because is has been isolated from other land masses for over 160 million years, the country contains an extremely high number of endemic species—plants and animals that cannot be found anywhere else on Earth. Nearly 13,000 species of plants and vertebrate animals are found exclusively on Madagascar, including over 90 percent of the island's reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. Tragically, less than 10 percent of Madagascar's original habitat is still pristine, and a number of its unique species are at risk. Forty-five animals that recently inhabited the island are now extinct, and nearly 200 others are threatened or endangered. Madagascar's government has recently demonstrated a strong commitment to preserving the country's remaining biodiversity, and Academy scientists are working to provide government officials with the necessary data to make smart conservation decisions.</p>

<p>Since 1998, the Academy has been sending scientists to Madagascar to study the island's plants and land-dwelling animals. Over the past ten years, Academy entomologists, botanists, herpetologists, and invertebrate zoologists have identified more than a thousand new species from the island and its surrounding waters. </p>

<p>In November of 2006, the California Academy of Sciences officially inaugurated its new Madagascar Biodiversity Center in the country's capital city of Antananarivo. A product of the passion and dedication of Academy scientists Brian Fisher, Frank Almeda, and others, this new research facility was built on land donated by the Malagasy government and is conveniently located next to the Malagasy Academy of Sciences and the zoo. Its primary focus is to provide a venue to study Madagascar's vanishing plant and invertebrate fauna and—most importantly—to provide the training that will empower local biologists to achieve these goals. The center will also house the National Entomology Collection, a key piece of the island's biological puzzle.</p>

			<div id="pr_body"> <p align="left">SAN FRANCISCO ( August 28, 2008 ) — A 212,000-gallon aquarium tank is ready for its debut in San Francisco ’s Golden Gate Park . The tank, which stands 25 feet tall in the middle of the new California Academy of Sciences, holds the world’s deepest living coral reef display. When the Academy opens on September 27, 2008, visitors will be able to view the reef and its inhabitants from the surface as well as from five different underwater windows. </p> <p> Often called rainforests of the sea, coral reefs are the most diverse aquatic ecosystems on the planet. They are also among the most endangered – up to 70% of the world’s tropical coral reefs may disappear within the next 15 years due to the impacts of global warming and other environmental stresses. Worldwide, over 25% have already been destroyed or badly damaged. These ecosystems are important to save, not only because of the biodiversity they contain, but because they provide protection for coastal communities against tropical storms, hurricanes and typhoons. Additionally, hundreds of millions of people depend on coral reefs for their livelihood or for food. Despite their global importance, most people on the planet have never seen a living reef. When the new California Academy of Sciences opens, over a million visitors a year will be able to experience the splendor of a living Philippine coral reef and learn what they can do to help save coral reefs around the world. </p> <p> The Academy chose to feature a Philippine coral reef because the reef systems in the Philippines are among the most diverse in the world. The new tank will hold a variety of delicate soft and hard corals, as well as sharks, rays, and more than 2,000 colorful reef fishes. All of the animals will be captive bred, or will come from sustainable wild sources, highlighting the importance of in-country research and conservation programs. </p> <p> In preparation for the opening of the new exhibit, the Academy grew corals in its temporary facility at 875 Howard Street. In one tank, which measured 18 feet deep, Academy biologists grew corals on adjustable racks to determine which species grew best at different depths. This 20,000-gallon experimental tank held about 200 square feet of living corals, as well as several hundred reef fish. Additionally, the Academy installed 46 smaller tanks at Howard Street that were dedicated to the coral rearing program. These tanks, called “coral rearing pods,” were actually agricultural bins that had been fitted out with life support systems. Each pod could hold 16 square feet of living corals. </p> <p> Although they look like underwater plants, corals are actually animals that are related to anemones and jellyfish . Because these animals are able to reproduce asexually, biologists can grow new corals by breaking off pieces of an existing coral colony and affixing them to new pieces of rock. Academy biologists use a variety of creative tools to encourage corals to attach themselves to new substrates, including superglue, rubber bands, toothpicks, epoxy putty and fishing line. The coral rearing pods at Howard Street were “planted” with small pieces of coral that had been broken off from larger colonies. </p> <p> It is a challenge to grow corals at depths greater than six feet, since it is difficult to replicate the energy from a tropical sun. In the new Academy, the ceiling above the new Philippine coral reef tank is studded with skylights, to allow the maximum amount of daylight to reach the reef below. To supplement that natural light, the Academy installed 120 metal halide lamps, which simulate the intensity and spectrum of natural sunlight. These powerful lights were originally designed to flood football stadiums with light. The new tank also employs powerful filtration systems to accommodate the high level of biomass it contains. All 212,000 gallons of water in the tank are filtered once every 45 minutes. Additionally, a water jet system simulates wave action and stimulates the corals. </p> <p> When the spectacular new exhibit opens, it will incorporate interactive displays and regular in-tank diver presentations. To support its dive programs, the new Academy is recruiting over 100 volunteer divers to help maintain the large exhibits, feed the animals, and interact with the public . Academy scientists will also use the tank as a resource for their scientific studies.</p> <p><b> About the new California Academy of Sciences </b></p> <p> Designed by Pritzker prize-winning architect Renzo Piano with local partner Stantec Architecture (formerly Chong Partners Architecture), the new California Academy of Sciences will combine inspiring architecture with inventive exhibits to provide eye-opening interactions with the natural world for its visitors. Topped with a living planted roof, the new building will also integrate the Academy more sensitively into its natural environment in Golden Gate Park. The new facility will employ energy-efficient, environmentally-sensitive building strategies to help set a standard for sustainable architecture in civic buildings. In 2005, it received the silver Holcim Award for sustainable construction in North America. The estimated total cost of the project is $488 million, including building, exhibition, relocation and interim operation costs. </p>

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER NEW SPECIES OF GIANT ELEPHANT-SHREW 
<p align="center" class="crumblinks"><b> Related to sea cows and elephants, it lives in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania
New mammal is the largest elephant-shrew discovered to date
</b></p>


<p>SAN FRANCISCO (January 16, 2008) - Although there is unquestionably much left to be discovered about life on Earth, charismatic animals like mammals are usually well documented, and it is rare to find a new species today-especially from a group as intriguing as the elephant-shrews, monogamous mammals found only in Africa with a colorful history of misunderstood ancestry. Like shrews, these small, furry mammals eat mostly insects. Early scientists named them elephant-shrews not because they thought the animals were related to elephants but because of their long, flexible snouts. Ironically, recent molecular research has shown that they are actually more closely related to elephants than to shrews. Members of a supercohort called Afrotheria that evolved in Africa over 100 million years ago, their relatives include elephants, sea cows, and the aardvark. Until recently, only 15 species of elephant-shrews, also called sengis to avoid confusion with true shrews, were known to science. However, in March of 2006, Galen Rathbun of the California Academy of Sciences, Francesco Rovero of the Trento Museum of Natural Sciences, and a team of collaborators confirmed the existence of a new species that lives only in two high-altitude forest blocks in the mountains of south-central Tanzania. Their discovery will appear in the February 4 issue of The Journal of Zoology published by Wiley-Blackwell (available online on January 31).</p>

<p>"This is one of the most exciting discoveries of my career," said Rathbun, who has studied the ecology, social structure, and evolution of sengis for more than 30 years.  "It is the first new species of giant elephant-shrew to be discovered in more than 126 years. From the moment I first lifted one of the animals into our photography tent, I knew it must be a new species-not just because of its distinct coloring, but because it was so heavy!" The new species, which has been named the grey-faced sengi (Rhynchocyon udzungwensis), weighs about 700 grams (1.5 pounds), which is more than 25 percent larger than any other known sengi.</p>

<p>The new sengi was first caught on film in 2005, when Francesco Rovero of the Trento Museum of Natural Sciences in Italy set up camera traps inside the remote Ndundulu Forest in Tanzania's Udzungwa Mountains, where he was surveying the region's forest mammals. When the cameras recorded an elephant-shrew that looked unfamiliar, he sent the photos to Rathbun for identification, who determined that the colorful animal appeared to be a new species. In March of 2006, they embarked on a two-week expedition with a team of colleagues to search for specimens to confirm the discovery.</p>

<p>Although it was supposed to be the dry season, the rains came early, and the traps they had brought with them turned out to be too small for the surprisingly large sengis. But with perseverance and the help of some traditional twine snares, they were able to capture four animals and make 40 observations, confirming the presence of a new species. Its unique features include a distinctive grey face and a jet-black lower rump, as well as a large body size. So far, the new giant sengi (Rhynchocyon udzungwensis) is known to exist in only two populations that cover about 300 square kilometers (115 square miles) of forest in Tanzania. The other three species in the genus Rhynchocyon are also rare due to restricted and fragmented forest habitats-one is listed as endangered by the IUCN, another is listed as near-threatened, and the third is on the vulnerable list. </p>

<p>The Udzungwa Mountains are part of a series of ancient and isolated mountain blocks stretching from southern Kenya to south-central Tanzania. The age, isolation and fragmented nature of the forests in these mountains have combined to produce high levels of biodiversity, including many species that cannot be found anywhere else on Earth. In recent years, a number of other new species have been found there, including the Udzungwa partridge, the Phillips' Congo shrew, a monkey known as the kipunji, and several amphibians and reptiles. "This new discovery highlights how exceptionally important the Udzungwa Mountain rain forests are, and how little we know about them," said Rovero.</p>

<p>The newly discovered grey-faced sengi is just one of many species in need of protection in the Udzungwa Mountains, which serve as an important dry-season refuge for many animals from adjacent areas. A recent survey suggests that the few remaining wildlife corridors linking the mountains to surrounding protected areas are critically threatened, and will be lost by the end of 2009 without intervention. Recent conservation efforts have resulted in the establishment of the Kilombero Nature Reserve, raising hopes for enhanced long-term protection of some important forests, including Ndundulu where the new sengi was found. Still, without more funding, the legal protection afforded by the reserve will be difficult to enforce. "We hope that new discoveries like ours will help bolster efforts to conserve this spectacular ecosystem," says Rathbun.</p>

<p>Additional collaborators and expedition members included Andrew Perkin of Oxford Brookes University, Trevor Jones of Anglia Ruskin University, David Ribble of Trinity University, and Nike Doggart, Charles Leonard and Ruben Mwakisoma of the Tanzania Forest Conservation Group. Funding was provided by the National Geographic Society, the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund and the Trento Museum of Natural Sciences, Italy.</p>

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 3, 2008) — Despite the fact that 150 years have passed since Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection, most American adults still do not understand one of the basic tenets of modern science. In a 2007 Gallup poll, 66 percent of adults indicated their belief that humans were created in their present form within the last 10,000 years. To tackle this gap in scientific literacy, the California Academy of Sciences is leading a San Francisco city-wide celebration of evolution this spring, beginning with a kick-off party on February 12, 2009—the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.<br><br>Throughout the spring, the Academy and other San Francisco cultural institutions, including the Friends of the San Francisco Public Library, the San Francisco Botanical Garden, and the Jewish Community Center of San Francisco, will host a series of evolution-themed programs and events designed to boost public understanding about evolutionary theory and its applications in modern science. The city-wide celebration, called "EVOLVE 2009," will include over 30 separate events and is expected to be the largest celebration of the Darwin anniversaries in the country.<br><br>The California Academy of Sciences is one of the world's preeminent natural history museums and is an international leader in scientific research about the natural world, including the distribution and evolution of life on Earth. During the "EVOLVE 2009" festivities, the Academy's scientists will share their perspective on Darwin—along with their most recent research about evolution—through lectures, programs, and a special audio tour. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div align="left"><p><b>"EVOLVE 2009" Events at the California Academy of Sciences</b><br>In addition to the scheduled programs below, visitors to the Academy will have the opportunity to take a special cell-phone-based audio tour beginning February 12 that highlights examples of evolution in action.

How did a quiet 27-year-old, who had been isolated for five years on a voyage around the world, develop the most provocative idea of the past 200 years? The concept of natural selection did not suddenly come to him one day in the bath (the way Archimedes supposedly discovered the phenomenon of specific gravity).

During this heyday, no middle-class home was without its display of sea shells, butterflies, or stuffed birds—the home aquarium became fashionable, nature guides were bestsellers, and the first dinosaur theme park was built. Most of today's great public science museums, including the California Academy of Sciences, were founded amid this enchantment with natural history.

The California Academy of Sciences, with its broad mission to explore, explain, and protect the natural world, recognizes that evolution is fundamental to understanding biological diversity and is a critical organizing principle for both scientific research and science museums.</p>    <p>   <br>In biology, the basic facts of evolution, including the extinction and emergence of new species over time, were understood and accepted by the end of the nineteenth century. Charles Darwin identified natural selection as a primary mechanism driving evolution (that some organisms are more likely to survive and reproduce, thus their genetic traits will be inherited by future generations while other traits will be lost). Through selection, some life-forms thrive, reproduce, and adapt as conditions change, whereas others disappear. The detailed processes that create variation and drive natural selection became evident during the twentieth century with the discoveries of DNA and molecular inheritance. Twentieth century geologists also learned to use radioactivity to determine the age of the Earth (4.5 billion years), and astronomers discovered the expansion of the universe, measuring its age as approximately 14 billion years. Change is an inherent property of stars, planets, and life.<br><br>   Scientists in many fields use evolutionary concepts daily in their research. In pharmacology and agriculture, these concepts are central to efforts to overcome the evolution of harmful organisms that have become resistant to antibiotics or pesticides. Evolution as the organizing principle for science museums has transformed the eighteenth-century collections of "curiosities" into modern museums of natural history. The California Academy of Sciences recognizes the importance of understanding evolution for both scientists and the public, and we emphasize that evolution belongs in school curricula and textbooks as one of the fundamental concepts of modern science.</p>

			<div id="pr_body"> <p> SAN FRANCISCO (September 18, 2008) — When Morrison Planetarium opens on September 27 as part of the new California Academy of Sciences, t he premier attraction in the new dome will be the immersive digital video productions designed by the Academy’s visualization studio. The inaugural production will be <i>Fragile Planet</i>, a 30-minute virtual journey from Earth to the outer reaches of the Universe and back—a journey that reveals how special Earth really is. Narrated by Sigourney Weaver and interwoven with talks by a live presenter, <i>Fragile Planet</i> begins inside Morrison Planetarium, lifts off through the roof of the Academy, zooms outside the atmosphere, and gives audiences an astronaut’s view of Earth. The journey then continues to the Moon, Mars, and beyond the Milky Way to search for habitats that might host extraterrestrial life. The show’s theme—that Earth is the only known haven for life, and thus is important to protect—echoes the themes of biodiversity and sustainability that run throughout the rest of the Academy’s exhibits. </p> <p> The visual foundation of the show lies in scientific visualization, utilizing observed data as the starting point for the imagery in the program—more than three dozen researchers and institutions provided data in support of <i>Fragile Planet</i>. Their contributions range from high-resolution satellite imagery of Earth to the positions of galaxies more than 50 million light years distant. From the three-dimensional terrain of Valles Marineris on Mars to the locations of extrasolar planetary systems in interstellar space, everything audiences will see in <i>Fragile Planet</i> has a basis in astronomers’ best understanding of the Universe. Scenes that required extrapolation from known observations were developed with the assistance of researchers with expertise in the relevant topics. </p> <p><i> Fragile Planet</i> was written and produced by the Academy’s visualization studio, staffed by a team whose collective credits include work at the American Museum of Natural History, Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), Pixar, and Lucasfilm Animation. For two sequences in the show, the Academy’s visualization studio collaborated with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and separately with San Rafael-based digital studio element FX. Additional associations make <i>Fragile Planet</i> a truly international endeavor. The Swedish software developer SCISS AB provided support for creating accurate renditions of planets based on current NASA data, and the company teamed with Academy technical directors to create a reliable interface between their specialized astronomy software and tools used by computer animators. The German software company Xfrog worked closely with Academy botanists to replicate the native California plants that carpet the roof of the virtual model of the Academy building. Display specialists from U.K.-based Global Immersion also partnered with the Academy’s visualization studio to refine techniques for planetarium production, and technical consulting was provided by U.K.-based Visual Acuity. </p> <p> The spectacular visuals are augmented by an audio environment that is as immersive as the imagery. Composer and sound designer Michael Stearns has composed for numerous large-format films, including <i>Chronos</i>, <i>Ring of Fire</i>, and <i>To the Limit</i>, as well as for traditional theatrical releases including <i>Baraka</i> and <i>Titanic</i>. Stearns brings particular expertise in creating soundscapes for immersive environments, having worked in both planetariums and “ride films,” such as <i>Back to the Future</i> at Universal Studios and <i>Star Trek: The Experience</i> for Paramount . </p> <p><i> Fragile Planet</i> opens September 27, 2008, and plays seven times a day, seven days a week.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 17, 2008) – San Francisco residents will have expanded opportunities to visit the newly rebuilt California Academy of Sciences free of charge during its first year of operation.  Over the past ten years, thousands of San Francisco residents have visited the Academy during Neighborhood Free Days each year.  In 2009, the first year after the Academy's reopening in Golden Gate Park, the number of Neighborhood Free Days will double.  Each neighborhood, defined by zip codes, will have two opportunities to visit the Academy for free over a three-day weekend (Friday, Saturday or Sunday).   The first series of weekends runs from May 1-June 14, 2009, and the second from September 11-November 8, 2009. </p>   <p>"Access to cultural and educational institutions is one of our top community priorities at Bank of America because it’s one of the things our associates, customers and other Californians tell us they care deeply about," said Janet Lamkin, President of Bank of America California. "Investing in venues like the California Academy of Sciences enriches the lives of people who visit them and contributes substantially to the local economy." </p>  <p>Each visiting adult must prove residency by showing a driver's license or a utility bill. Only residents from the zip codes invited on the designated dates will be admitted free of charge. Information about Neighborhood Free Days is available at www.calacademy.org and at (415) 379-8000.

			<div id="pr_body">  <p> SAN FRANCISCO (October 8, 2008) — The new California Academy of Sciences is now officially the greenest museum in the world. On October 7, 2008, the U.S. Green Building Council issued its formal rating for the new Academy, awarding the Renzo Piano-designed facility with its highest possible certification: LEED Platinum. The new building, which houses an aquarium, planetarium, natural history museum, and world-class research and education programs under one living roof, stands as an embodiment of the Academy’s mission to explore, explain and protect the natural world. It is now the largest public Platinum-rated building in the world, and with a total score of 54 points, it is also the world’s most sustainable museum building. </p> <p> The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system is a voluntary, consensus-based standard for evaluating high-performance, sustainable buildings. By earning points across a variety of sustainability categories, buildings can earn a basic certification (at least 26 points), a Silver rating (at least 33 points), a Gold rating (at least 39 points) or a Platinum rating (at least 52 points). The new home for the California Academy of Sciences was evaluated and earned points across six different categories: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation and design process. Based on a wide range of green building technologies and strategies, including recycled building materials, natural ventilation, solar energy generation, and an iconic living roof, it was awarded a total of 54 points, exceeding the threshold for a Platinum certification. </p> <p> The California Academy of Sciences is one of the world’s preeminent natural history museums and is an international leader in scientific research about the natural world. Founded in 1853 as the first scientific institution in the West, it is the only institution in the world to house an aquarium, planetarium, natural history museum, and scientific research program under one roof. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the Academy’s home in Golden Gate Park but came with a silver lining: the opportunity to reinvent the facility from the ground up. After nearly a decade of planning and the largest cultural fundraising effort in San Francisco history, the new Academy opened to the public on September 27. This major new initiative builds on the Academy’s distinguished history and deepens its commitment to advancing scientific literacy, engaging the public, and documenting and conserving Earth’s natural resources. </p> <p> “When the Academy was faced with the need to rebuild, the institution’s visionary Board of Trustees committed to building a new home that was as sustainable as possible,” said Academy Executive Director Dr. Gregory Farrington. “Our goal was to create a new facility that would not only hold powerful exhibits but serve as one itself, inspiring visitors to conserve natural resources and help sustain the diversity of life on Earth.” </p> <p><b>Green Building Features </b></p> <p>Employing a wide range of green technologies and strategies, the new Academy will use about 30-35% less energy than required by standard building code. It will also generate a portion of its own energy, conserve water, and create new habitat for local wildlife. Exhibit signage throughout the building highlights these green features.</p> <p><b> Heat and Humidity </b></p> <ul><li> Radiant floor heating reduces energy needs by 5-10%. </li>   <li> Heat recovery systems capture and utilize heat produced by HVAC equipment, reducing heating energy use. </li>   <li> The planted roof provides a superior thermal insulating layer for the building, reducing energy needs for air-conditioning. </li>   <li> High-performance glass is used throughout the building, reducing standard levels of heat absorption and decreasing the cooling load. </li></ul><p><b>Natural Light and Ventilation </b></p> <ul><li>At least 90% of regularly occupied spaces have access to daylight and outside views, reducing energy use and heat gain from electric lighting. </li>   <li>The undulating roofline draws cool air into the open piazza at the center of the building, naturally ventilating the surrounding exhibit spaces.

			<div id="pr_body"> <p> SAN FRANCISCO (September 18, 2008) — One of the world’s most innovative museum building programs—a record-setting, sustainable new home for the California Academy of Sciences—has reached completion in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park. After nearly a decade of planning and the largest cultural fundraising effort in San Francisco history, the new Academy will open to the public on September 27. Designed by Pritzker Prize winner Renzo Piano, the new building stands as an embodiment of the Academy’s mission to explore, explain and protect the natural world. Expected to earn a LEED Platinum certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, the new Academy is topped with a 2.5-acre living roof and employs a wide range of energy-saving materials and technologies. </p> <p> The California Academy of Sciences is one of the world’s preeminent natural history museums and is an international leader in scientific research about the natural world. Founded in 1853 as the first scientific institution in the West, it is the only institution in the world to house an aquarium, planetarium, natural history museum, and world-class research and education programs under one roof. This major new initiative builds on the Academy’s distinguished history and deepens its commitment to advancing scientific literacy, engaging the public, and documenting and conserving Earth’s natural resources. </p> <p> “Science is more influential and relevant to our daily lives than ever before, and natural history museums can and must deal head-on with the issues of the 21st century,” said Academy Executive Director Dr. Gregory Farrington. “Our goal was to create a new facility that would not only hold powerful exhibits but serve as one itself, inspiring visitors to conserve natural resources and help sustain the diversity of life on Earth.” </p> <p><b>Design Driven by Nature <br></b>The Renzo Piano Building Workshop, in collaboration with local firm Stantec Architecture (formerly Chong Partners), worked with the Academy to create a design that grows out of the institution’s mission, history, and setting. The new design unifies the Academy’s original array of twelve buildings, which were built over eight decades, into a single modern landmark that places a visual and intellectual emphasis on the natural world. </p> <p> “With the new Academy, we are creating a museum that is visually and functionally linked to its natural surroundings, metaphorically lifting up a piece of the park and putting a building underneath,” says architect Renzo Piano. “We are excited to collaborate with the Academy on a project in which design and mission are so seamlessly integrated. Through sustainable architecture and innovative design we are adding a vital new element to Golden Gate Park and expressing the Academy’s dedication to environmental responsibility.” </p> <p> Piano’s goal was to create a sense of transparency and connectedness between the building and the park through both a careful selection of materials and a thoughtful arrangement of space. Glass is used extensively in the exterior walls, allowing visitors to look through the museum to the surrounding green space of the park along both the east-west axis and the north-south axis of the building. The glass, which is manufactured in Germany, is famous for its especially clear composition. To enhance the open, airy feeling created by the glass, Piano designed the central support columns to be extremely slender. A series of carefully configured cables prevent these slim columns from bending. The concrete for the walls and floors will remain untreated, continuing the emphasis on natural materials. </p> <p> “Museums are not usually transparent,” says Piano. “They are opaque, they are closed. They are like a kingdom of darkness, and you are trapped inside. You don’t see where you are. But here we are building a natural history museum in the middle of a park, and those are two things that should belong to each other. They should be as connected as possible.” </p> <p> The building is topped by a colorful living roof—a 2.5 acre expanse of native California plants and wildflowers that creates a new link in the ecological corridor for wildlife. Steep undulations in the roofline roll over the Academy’s domed planetarium, rainforest, and aquarium exhibits, echoing the topography of the building’s setting and evoking the interdependence of biological and earth systems. </p> <p> The new Academy site is located directly across from the new de Young museum, which opened in October 2005 and was designed by Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron. The architectural dialogue between the two buildings and their unique responses to the environment of Golden Gate Park furthers San Francisco’s growing role in supporting groundbreaking architecture and design. </p> <p><b>Setting a New Standard for Sustainable Architecture <br></b>The new Academy is one of ten pilot “green building” projects of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, part of a vanguard initiative to develop models for workable, sustainable public architecture. Designed to be the greenest museum in the world, the new Academy optimizes the use of resources, minimizes environmental impacts, and serves as an educational model by demonstrating how humans can live and work in environmentally-responsible ways. The new facility integrates architecture and landscape, and helps to set a new standard for energy efficiency and environmentally responsible engineering systems in a public, architecturally distinguished building. </p> <p> In Piano’s design, the environmentally sensitive components of the building are featured, rather than hidden. The living roof, which reduces storm water runoff by up to 3.6 million gallons of water per year, includes an observation deck, allowing visitors to admire the rooftop wildlife haven and learn about the benefits of this sustainable feature. The roof is bordered by a glass canopy containing nearly 60,000 photo voltaic cells, which will produce up to 10 percent of the Academy’s annual energy needs. These photo voltaic cells are clearly visible in the glass canopy, providing both shade and visual interest for the visitors below. Additional green features throughout the building are highlighted with informational signage. </p> <p> There are varying shades of green as measured by the U.S. Green Building Council through its LEED™ (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system. The LEED rating system is a voluntary, consensus-based national standard for evaluating high-performance, sustainable buildings. Through all aspects of design and construction, the Academy will strive to achieve the highest possible rating: LEED platinum. The Academy’s rating is expected to be awarded by the end of 2008. </p> <p> In recognition of this commitment to sustainable “green” design, the Academy project was selected as the North American winner of the silver Holcim Award for Sustainable Construction in September 2005. The competition, organized by the Holcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction in collaboration with five of the world’s leading technical universities, promotes sustainable approaches to the built environment. </p> <p> The Academy was also awarded the EPA’s regional 2006 Environmental Award in recognition of the new building’s sustainable design. The EPA received more than 160 nominations in 2006; the Academy of Sciences was one of 39 recipients to be selected in this very elite group of environmental champions. </p> <p><b>Innovative Exhibits and Programs </b><br> Unlike the dark halls and “cabinet of curiosities” displays that have traditionally characterized natural history museums, the new Academy’s open, airy galleries are bursting with light and life. Its exhibits address not only the history of life on Earth, but also its future, engaging visitors in conversations about two of the most important scientific questions of our time: “<i>How did life evolve?</i>” and “<i>How will it survive?</i>”. </p> <p> From the colony of penguins swimming in African Hall (members of the Species Survival Plan breeding program) to the wildflowers blooming on the iconic living roof (sources of nectar for local birds and butterflies), the Academy’s exhibits bring new vibrancy to topics like biodiversity and sustainability. The 38,000 animals of Steinhart Aquarium, once confined to their own halls, are now found throughout the building. The exhibits are also infused with human life—Academy scientists and trained docents are a critical component of the exhibition program, facilitating discussions and providing hands-on learning opportunities. New technologies appear not only inside the planetarium dome, but also throughout the museum and aquarium displays, creating additional opportunities for interaction. </p> <p> The exhibits will draw heavily on the Academy’s own research, incorporating many of the scientific specimens Academy scientists have collected over the past 155 years. The stories behind these specimens are told through videos, graphic panels, podcasts, and live programming. Windows into an active research laboratory and collections room create additional transparency between the Academy’s scientific and public faces. </p><ul><li><b>For a complete list of current and upcoming exhibits</b>, please <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2011/exhibits_overview.php" target="_blank" title="Exhibits Overview">click here</a> to see the current Exhibits Overview document, or contact the Academy Communications Department.</li></ul><p><b>Public Art Installations by Maya Lin </b><br>     The Academy and the San Francisco Arts Commission selected Maya Lin to create two public art installations in association with the new facility. The first installation, a tubular wire sculpture called “Where the Land Meets the Sea,” hangs from the solar canopy on the west side of the building. The 36 foot by 60 foot wire landscape describes the terrain both above and below water level of the San Francisco Bay, including Angel Island and the Marin Headlands. The sculpture, which Lin refers to as “a drawing in space,” calls attention to the fact that although we think of water and land as two separate entities, they are quite literally connected to one another. The second work, which will be installed beneath the solar canopy on the east side of the building, will be unveiled in late 2009. Entitled "What is Missing?", it is part of Lin's last memorial - a memorial to extinct and endangered species and places. "What is Missing?" will reconceive the traditional monument, existing in several mediums and locations simultaneously. In addition to an installation at the Academy, the memorial will also take the form of a website, and a traveling dark room with projected images and sounds from a variety of endangered species. </p>  <p><b>Sustainable Dining Options</b> <br> Renowned chefs Loretta Keller (chef and owner of COCO5OO) and Charles Phan (chef and owner of The Slanted Door) have partnered to create an innovative new café and restaurant for the Academy. The casual Academy Café and the full service Moss Room will be treated like exhibits, encouraging visitors to ponder the vital relationship between food and culture, and to consider the benefits of eating sustainably. Both menus will highlight local, seasonal, organic produce; sustainable seafood that adheres to the Academy’s Seafood Watch standards; and locally-sourced, hormone-free meats. Additionally, featured menu offerings will be created to complement temporary exhibits and special programming elsewhere in the museum. </p> <p> <b>About the Renzo Piano Building Workshop </b><br> Renzo Piano has emerged as the leading architect for museum projects in the United States. In addition to his design for the California Academy of Sciences, Piano is currently working on or has recently completed designs for the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, and the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York. The firm was also selected to design the New York Times Building, a new satellite campus for New York’s Columbia University, and the London Tower Bridge. Among his completed projects are the Menil Collection Museum in Houston, the Beyeler Foundation Museum in Basel, the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, the Kansai Air Terminal in Osaka, and the reconstruction of the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. His buildings show a sensitivity for the design, habitability, and sustainability of structures. Renzo Piano is a winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize – considered to be the architectural equivalent of the Nobel Prize, as well as the AIA Gold Medal.</p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 22, 2008) — It's time to break your old routine; make this year's resolution green! While shedding weight and quitting bad habits will likely always be among the most popular resolutions, the California Academy of Sciences is urging Americans to give the planet a happy New Year in 2009 by adding a different type of resolution to their annual goal-setting session. The Academy has made it easy to adopt a "New Year's Resolution for the Planet"  by producing <i>Sustainability Made Simple</i>, a free, pocket-sized guide filled with basic steps that anyone can take to green their life. Organized into the broad themes of transportation, food, and home practices, each suggestion consists of three steps that progress from the simplest to the most complex.  A few examples are listed below.</p> <p><b>Driving Habits</b><br><b>Step 1)</b> Conserve gas by driving the speed limit.<br><b>Step 2)</b> Turn off your engine rather than idling when you are still for more than a few minutes.<br><b>Step 3)</b> Open your windows when going slowly; close your windows and switch on the A/C when on the freeway.</p> <p><b>Home Heating and Cooling</b><br><b>Step 1)</b> Keep your thermostat at 78 degrees F in the summer and 68 degrees F in the winter.<br><b>Step 2)</b> Turn down heat or air conditioning when you are sleeping or not at home.<br><b>Step 3)</b> Install a programmable thermostat to ensure your home's temperature is optimal for your comfort and for the environment.</p> <p>Many "New Year's Resolutions for the Planet" are just as healthy for your body as they are for the Earth. To drop pounds and carbon dioxide emissions at the same time, consider the following tips from <i>Sustainability Made Simple</i>:  eat fewer processed foods, reduce the amount of beef in your diet (and when you do eat beef, look for free-range, grass-fed beef), and walk or ride your bike for short trips. As an added incentive to opt for self-powered transportation, the Academy offers a $3 discount to each visitor who walks or rides their bike to the museum.</p>	 <p>The Academy's <i>Sustainability Made Simple</i> card is available for download now at www.calacademy.org. While on the website, visitors can take a poll, post comments, or "tweet" to announce which eco-friendly steps they pledge to take in 2009.  Printed cards will also be available at the Academy starting in January.</p>   <p>Content for <i>Sustainability Made Simple</i> was generated by Academy scientists and educators, with support from Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the Academy's lead sustainability sponsor.</p>   <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth's living things. The Academy has a staff of over 50 professional educators and Ph.D.-level scientists, supported by more than 100 Research and Field Associates and over 300 Fellows. It conducts research in 11 fields of study that focus on two of the most important scientific questions of our time: <i>“How did life evolve?”</i> and <i>“How will it survive?”</i></p>

			<div id="pr_body"> <p> SAN FRANCISCO (August 19, 2008) — After years of anticipation, the doors of the new California Academy of Sciences will open to the general public for the first time on the weekend of September 27-28 in Golden Gate Park. A weekend-long celebration of science will mark the occasion, presented by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The main attraction will be the Academy itself and the innovative exhibits and animals inside, but the celebration will also spread out onto the Music Concourse in front of the Academy, with science and art activities for visitors of all ages, and food and entertainment from around the world. Admission will be free on Saturday the 27th, and the museum will be open with extended hours on both days.</p>  <p><b>A Momentous Occasion<br></b>Architect Renzo Piano, Executive Director Greg Farrington, Mayor Gavin Newsom, and other officials will commemorate the completion of the new Academy with an opening ceremony at 8:30 am on Saturday, September 27th. Following the hour-long ceremony, the doors will open, allowing visitors to explore the Rainforests of the World, the outer reaches of the Universe, the depths of a Philippine coral reef, the remote islands of Madagascar and the Galapagos, and numerous other exhibits for the first time.</p> <p>Saturday, September 27 <br> Opening Ceremony: 8:30am<br> Hours of Operation: 9:30am-9:00pm<br><i>Admission is free</i></p> <p>Sunday, September 28 <br> Hours of Operation: 9:30am-5pm <br><i>General admission rates apply <br> Tickets can be purchased in advance at www.calacademy.org or at the door</i></p>  <p><b>Celebrating with Eco-Friendly Flair</b><br>Just as the Academy's mission to explore, explain and protect the natural world informs all of the exhibits inside the Academy, it is also the guiding concept behind the activities on the Music Concourse. A bottle-free drinking water system will make free water available at stations throughout the concourse, along with biodegradable cups, eliminating plastic water bottles from the event entirely. Additionally, booths requiring generator power will use biodiesel fuel as a cleaner burning alternative to traditional fuels. </p> <p>The Academy's lead corporate sponsor, PG&amp;E, will be on-hand in the Music Concourse to share everyday green living tips with visitors. PG&amp;E recently awarded $1.5 million to the Academy to support the museum’s ongoing climate change and sustainability exhibits and programs. Over the next four years, PG&amp;E will help educate Californians about what they can do to protect our state’s natural heritage by participating in public programs, providing timely energy-related exhibit content, and sponsoring the Academy’s Altered State: Climate Change in California exhibit.</p> <p>At recycling and composting bins throughout the Music Concourse, volunteers from SF Environment will be standing by, helping people toss their items in the proper bins, and offering helpful tips for remembering what can be recycled and composted.</p>  <p><b>Music Concourse Activities</b><br>Visitors can enjoy interactive activities, as well as top-notch entertainers and food offerings, inside the Music Concourse all weekend long. Booths staffed by conservation organizations and energy experts will tie the themes being explored inside the Academy to ongoing efforts to help build healthier habitats for people and animals alike.</p> <p>In the concourse band shell, musicians and dancers representing cultures from around the world will perform throughout both days. A full schedule of events will be available at www.calacademy.org in advance. Children will be able to make science-themed arts and crafts projects, enjoy jugglers and face painters, climb a rock wall, and watch kid-friendly musicians and performers on-stage.</p> <p>A diverse group of food vendors was hand-selected for both their high quality offerings and their sustainable practices. Offerings will include tamales, fresh baked goods, fair-trade coffee, vegetarian cuisine, gourmet sandwiches and salads, wood-fired pizza, and Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream. By featuring organic and sustainable ingredients, using biodegradable packaging, and minimizing the use of disposable items, these vendors will help reduce the event’s environmental impact.</p>  <p><b>Getting There</b><br>The San Francisco Bike Coalition will provide a parking area for 2,500 bikes on Opening Weekend. Visitors arriving by public transit can follow the Penguin Path from 9th &amp; Irving or 8th &amp; Fulton right to the front of the Academy. Walking, biking or taking public transit to the Academy is encouraged year-round, and is good for $3 off of a general admission ticket. For visitors arriving by car, parking will be available in the Music Concourse Garage on a first-come, first-serve basis; drivers will be directed to alternative parking sites as needed.<br></p>

			<div id="pr_header"><b>WORLD’S LARGEST ALL-DIGITAL PLANETARIUM OPENS<br> IN SAN FRANCISCO’S GOLDEN GATE PARK ON SEPTEMBER 27 </b><p><i>Morrison Planetarium will be part of the new California Academy of Sciences</i> </p>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"> <p> SAN FRANCISCO ( September 18, 2008) — In 1952, when Germany’s Zeiss star projectors were unavailable in the wake of World War II, San Francisco’s Morrison Planetarium made history by opening as the first planetarium in the United States to operate a homemade star projector—a machine designed and built by staff at the California Academy of Sciences. On September 27, 2008, the Morrison will make history once again when it opens as part of the new California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park. Housed in a 90-foot diameter dome, the new Morrison Planetarium will employ the latest technologies to create unprecedented immersive experiences for its visitors. It will be the largest all-digital planetarium in the world. In addition, the 75-foot diameter screen will match the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles as the largest planetarium screen in North America. Inside the dome, new digital projector and software technologies, driven in part by advances in the video game industry, will allow the planetarium to produce the most accurate and interactive digital universe ever created, giving visitors the opportunity to tour the cosmos, “fly” to other planets, or embark on other spacy adventures. The 290-seat dome also has the capability to broadcast live NASA feeds related to current missions, connect visitors to Academy research expeditions around the world, and host other special events. </p> <p>“Our efforts will redefine how science visualization integrates into planetarium programming,” says Ryan Wyatt, the Director of Morrison Planetarium and Science Visualization. “Today’s technology allows us to convey scientific concepts with unprecedented fidelity, using actual research data as the foundation of our storytelling.” </p> <p>State-of-the-art digital technology for the dome was provided by Global Immersion, Sky-Skan, and SCISS. By partnering with three leaders in the field, the new Morrison benefits from the combined strengths and experience of companies that have helped create a revolution in planetarium design. “Technology plays a central role in modern planetariums, with relationships that last long past the delivery date of computers and projectors,” says Wyatt. “We look forward to working closely with the talented people in the companies we have selected.” </p> <p>Construction began on the new planetarium in September 2005, when contractors broke ground on the new Academy building site in Golden Gate Park. Unlike most planetarium domes, the new Morrison is tilted at a 30 degree angle, allowing visitors to feel that they are not just looking up at space but are sitting amidst the stars. Mimicking the tilt of planet Earth, this dome is cantilevered out over the museum’s 212,000-gallon Philippine Coral Reef tank. The tilted frame for the dome, composed of 100% recycled steel, was erected over the summer of 2006. This frame provides attachment points for the plaster and fiberglass panels that form the exterior surface of the dome. A NanoSeam projection screen—an innovative technology from Spitz, Inc.—was installed during the summer of 2008. </p> <p>Although the screen is constructed of separate aluminum panels, the seams between the panels are designed to disappear with proper lighting. Tiny perforations across the screen enable audio speakers and other equipment to be located above and around the outside of the screen, leaving the interior uncluttered. Properly lit, the dome will seem infinite to the entering visitor, creating a uniquely immersive experience and an accurate re-creation of many virtual environments—from Golden Gate Park to the Virgo Cluster, 60 million light years away. Audience members will view a show that fills almost half their field of view and moves at a rate of 30 images per second, which visually approximates an alternate reality—corresponding not to an experience under a dome, but to an experience inside an environment. “At its best, immersive video allows audiences to experience a virtual environment in an exceedingly visceral way,” says Wyatt. “An ‘immersed’ audience member becomes part of the action—and part of the science. We will bring the latest research to diverse audiences, capitalizing on the international research program at the California Academy of Sciences.” </p> <p>A wide variety of programming will be offered inside the new Morrison Planetarium. School group shows will be designed to meet California school standards and will be facilitated by an Academy educator. These shows will focus on the sun, moon, and solar system—the primary focus of the 3rd and 5th grade space sciences curriculum. Additional star shows geared toward adults and youths over the age of 10 will allow visitors to take a live tour of the Universe and discuss breaking astronomical news with an Academy facilitator. </p> <p>The premier attraction in the new dome, however, will be the immersive digital video productions designed by the Academy’s planetarium team. During opening year, the inaugural production will be Fragile Planet, a 30-minute virtual journey from Earth to the outer reaches of the Universe and back—a journey that reveals how special planet Earth really is. Narrated by Sigourney Weaver and interwoven with talks by a live presenter, Fragile Planet lifts off through the roof of the Academy, zooms outside the atmosphere, and gives audiences an astronaut’s view of Earth. The journey then continues to the Moon, Mars, and beyond the Milky Way to search for habitats that might host extraterrestrial life. The show’s theme—that Earth is the only known haven for life, and thus is important to protect—echoes the themes of biodiversity and sustainability that run throughout the rest of the Academy’s exhibits. Fragile Planet was written and produced by the Academy’s planetarium team, whose collective credits include work at the American Museum of Natural History, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Pixar, and Lucasfilm Animation. </p> <p>In the coming years, special events such as lectures, live coverage of NASA mission launches, and broadcasts from Academy field expeditions will also take place in the new Morrison Planetarium. The acoustics of the dome will also offer excellent opportunities for musical performances and other artistic events. </p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 7, 2008) - As the Arctic Ocean warms this century, shellfish, snails and other animals from the Pacific Ocean will resume an invasion of the northern Atlantic that was interrupted by cooling conditions three million years ago, predict Geerat Vermeij, professor of geology at the University of California, Davis, and Peter Roopnarine at the California Academy of Sciences. </p>  <p>Climate models predict a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean by 2050. That will restore conditions that last existed during the mid-Pliocene era around three to 3.5 million years ago. Several north Pacific species have relatives in the north Atlantic, and the fossil record shows a lot of invasion from the Pacific to the Atlantic at that time, Vermeij said.</p><p>When cold conditions returned, the Arctic route was cut off, mostly by a lack of food. As the ice melts, productivity in the Arctic will rise and the northward march of the molluscs will resume where it left off three million years ago.</p>    <p>Vermeij and Roopnarine reviewed literature on molluscs found in the Bering and Chuckchi seas between Alaska and eastern Siberia. At least 77 molluscan lineages, about a third of the species of shallow-water shellfish in the Bering Sea, have the potential to spread to the Atlantic, they concluded. </p><p>Three factors drove the one-way traffic across the Pole during the Pliocene. The Bering and Chukchi seas are very productive, with abundant food; there is a net northward flow of water from the Pacific through the Bering Strait; and strong competition in the Bering Sea means bigger, tougher animals.</p>  <p>But the invaders will not wipe out native species, the authors said. The fossil record shows that invasions rarely lead to species extinction in marine environments. Instead, the invasion will add new species and hybrids and increase competition in the North Atlantic.</p>  <p>"The composition and dynamics of North Atlantic communities will change," Roopnarine said. "But whether that will help or harm local fisheries is an open question. Humans may have to adapt as well."</p>  <p>In the paper, Vermeij and Roopnarine note that in the past, species expanded their ranges within and between oceans during warm periods.</p>  <p>"The interesting thing to me is that the fossil record has something to say about the consequences of global warming," Vermeij said.</p>  <p>The article was published in the Aug. 8 issue of the journal <i>Science</i>.</p>  <p><b>About UC Davis</b><br>The University of California is one of the world's foremost research and teaching institutions, and UC Davis, which celebrates its centennial this upcoming academic year, is the UC's flagship campus for environmental studies.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">    <b>Project Description </b>                         <p> The new Steinhart Aquarium is one of the most biodiverse and interactive aquariums in the world. Home to an estimated 38,000 animals representing more than 900 separate species, it offers guests an unprecedented view of underwater life and provides insight into the critical role that aquatic environments play in life on Earth. </p>   <b>Ties to the Past              </b>             <p> The original Steinhart Aquarium opened in Golden Gate Park in 1923. It quickly became world famous for its novel exhibits and unusual animals, and was the model for many of the public aquariums that opened in the years that followed. Several components of the old Steinhart Aquarium have returnedin the new aquarium, which opened back in the park in 2008, including the dramatic entrance columns, the vaulted ceiling, the sea horse railing, and the Swamp (alligator) exhibit. </p>   <b>New Exhibits </b>           <p> More than half of the public exhibit space in the new California Academy of Sciences is devoted to Steinhart Aquarium. New technologies and advances in animal husbandry have made it possible for the Steinhart to create a suite of stunning new aquarium exhibits, including the world’s deepest living reef tank, a four-level rainforest display, and a unique, ever-changing Water Planet exhibit. </p>   <b>Philippine Coral Reef </b>            <ul><li> The Coral Reef tank, which is the second largest living coral reef display in the world, will measure 12,000 sq feet and hold 212,000 gallons of water. </li><li> At a depth of 25 feet, the new coral reef display is the deepest exhibit of live corals in the world. Visitors are able to view the exhibit from the surface as well as from five underwater windows. </li><li> The exhibit houses a broad range of aquatic life from the coral reefs and mangroves of the Philippines, one of the most diverse reef systems in the world. These animals&nbsp; include delicate soft and hard corals, sharks, rays, and more than 2,000 colorful reef fish representing over 100 species. </li><li> All of the animals for the reef exhibits are captive bred, or come from sustainable wild sources, highlighting the importance of in-country research and conservation programs. </li><li> The special needs of the fish and corals are met by a sophisticated life support system that filters the entire tank volume about once an hour. 120 metal halide lamps emitting the ideal wavelengths for photosynthesis have been strategically placed to create an energy-efficient lighting system. Skylights in the roof also allow natural sunlight to reach the corals. </li><li> A glass “bridge” allows for close observation of black-tip reef sharks, bamboo sharks, cownose rays, and a honeycomb ray cruising just inches below the guests. </li><li> A jet system simulates ocean movements and stimulates the corals. </li><li> The exhibit also incorporates interactive displays, and regular in-tank diver presentations. To support its dive programs, the new Steinhart is recruiting over 40 volunteer divers to help maintain the large exhibits, feed the fish and interact with the public. </li></ul>   <b>Rainforests of the World </b>            <ul><li> The Rainforests of the World exhibit is contained within a glass dome that is 90 feet tall. Guests move through the exhibit by circling up a gently sloping ramp. After reaching the top, they descend through the trees inside a glass elevator. </li><li> The multi-level living rainforest exhibit takes visitors on a journey through four distinct and diverse rainforest environments: the Amazonian Flooded Forest; the Borneo Rainforest Floor; the Madagascar Rainforest Understory; and the Costa Rica Rainforest Canopy. </li><li> Plants and animals have been carefully chosen to represent specific habitats in nature. </li><li> Temperatures are maintained at 82-85°F, and humidity is maintained at 75% or above using a special misting system. Lighting is provided from skylights in the roof and metal halide lamps. </li><li> Interactive programs will be provided by the Aquarium’s biologists and docents, explaining the importance of rainforests and their threatened status. </li><li> The rainforest studies of the Academy’s research scientists are also highlighted, as they race to catalogue – and hopefully preserve - the world’s biodiversity before it disappears. </li><li> The flooded Amazon rainforest features a tunnel through a 100,000 gallon tank containing arapaima, giant catfish, vegetarian piranhas and tiny schooling tetras. Other live animals include a giant anaconda, piranhas, and freshwater sting rays.</li><li> The Borneo rainforest floor includes flying lizards, gliding frogs, fruit-eating bats, and various insects from the forest floor. </li><li> The live animals in the Madagascar rainforest exhibit include species that are unique to this threatened environment, including colorful forest frogs, bright green geckos and chameleons, and endangered Malagasy freshwater fish. </li><li> Under the domed skylights, the Costa Rica rainforest canopy features reptiles, amphibians and insects, as well as free flying birds and butterflies. </li></ul>    <b>California Coast </b>           <ul><li> The new California Coast exhibits, which present a range of habitats from salt marshes to turbulent rocky inlets, contain a wide variety of native birds, fish, and invertebrates from these incredibly rich and diverse environments. </li><li> The main tank – an exhibit featuring the marine habitats of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary – is a 100,000 gallon tank with large viewing windows and a specially created wave surge system. </li><li> A walkway along the surface of the main California Coast tank allows visitors to smell the seawater and peer down at the creatures below as waves roll into a salt marsh. </li><li> A Discovery Tidepool allows visitors to interact with live plants and animals, as well as the Aquarium’s specially trained biologists and docents. </li><li> Magnifiers, tiny cameras, and special viewing ports reveal the tiniest residents of the diverse habitats, including crabs, geoducks, fat innkeeper worms, and saltwater boatmen. </li><li> Other displays in the California Coast exhibit include the Tank of Giants, which holds huge sea bass and halibut, and the Southern California Kelp Forest, which houses colorful Garibaldis and other fish as they glide through strands of giant kelp. </li></ul>   <b>The Swamp </b>           <ul><li> Alligators and alligator snapping turtles have once again made their home inside the Swamp’s beloved sea horse railing. </li><li> Visitors can view the swamp inhabitants from the surface as well as from an underwater window. </li><li> Supporting exhibits feature alligator gars, rattlesnakes, frogs and salamanders. </li><li> A special story time area will allow Aquarium docents to inform guests about the natural history and human culture of the swamps of the Southeast United States. </li></ul><ul></ul>   <b>African Penguin Habitat </b>            <ul><li> The Steinhart’s colony of African penguins can be found at the end of African Hall. </li><li> A colony of twenty African penguins can be viewed through a window that is 26 feet wide and 16 feet tall. </li><li> The 25,000 gallon tank has a jet system designed to simulate wave action and stimulate the activities of the birds. </li><li> The life support system for this exhibit filters the water every 30 minutes, and maintains the water at a chilly 50°F. </li><li> Steinhart’s penguins are part of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association’s Species Survival Program, aimed at conserving this species in the wild. </li><li>African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) live off the coast of South   Africa and Namibia.  In 2010, the IUCN classified the species as endangered, or at very high risk of extinction in the wild.</li></ul><ul></ul>   <b>Water Planet </b>           <ul><li>Dozens of tanks, from five to 5000 gallons in size, explore what it takes to survive under water – in an environment that is very alien to humans. </li><li> Fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates are displayed, and a wide range of interactive media are used entice, amuse, and inform people of all ages. </li><li> This exhibit area has been designed to be infinitely flexible, allowing Steinhart biologists to change the exhibits frequently and display species that have rarely been seen before, providing reasons to visit again and again. </li><li> The exhibit also features a video about the importance of water on the planet. The show, which is narrated by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, outlines the properties of water, its link to the origin of life on Earth, and the need to conserve this precious resource.</li></ul>   <b>Life Support Systems </b>           <ul><li> Over 7.4 miles of piping deliver fresh and salt water to Steinhart’s tanks. </li><li> Natural systems are used to purify nitrate wastes, ensuring that aquarium water can be recycled. </li><li> 20 sand filters, and three carbon and sand filters remove impurities from the aquarium’s salt water, which is piped directly from the Pacific Ocean. </li></ul><ul></ul>         <b>Project Team</b>           <p>Architecture: Renzo Piano Building Workshop (Genoa, Italy); Stantec Architecture (formerly Chong Partners Architecture) (San Francisco, CA).

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">  <p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 21, 2008) — Where there is life, there must be water. And where water is detected, life is almost always found. This critical relationship between water and life is the subject of an innovative new exhibit that will open on September 27 as part of the new California Academy of Sciences. </p> <p> Silvery, sculpted walls and dramatic lighting set the scene for a unique foray into the Water Planet exhibit. Constructed using new technologies for computer-aided design and fabrication, the complex molded surfaces seemingly flow into one another, inviting touch and creating an immersive, watery setting. Fluidly-shaped openings in these walls provide windows into dozens of aquarium tanks. In the center of the room, three low islands combine additional live animal displays with interactive "touch surfaces" and innovative water elements to address the physical and chemical properties of water. The perimeter walls double as a surround-view theater screen; a five-minute movie about the central role of water on our planet plays across their surfaces once an hour. </p> <p>While most aquarium exhibits are organized by geography, the live animal displays in Water Planet are grouped by adaptation to life in and around water. Along the perimeter of the exhibit, seven clusters of tanks focus on adaptations for feeding, locomotion, reproduction, defense, sensing, surviving in deserts, and living in and out of water. Animals that have evolved particularly interesting solutions to these functions are featured in each cluster. The sensing cluster, for instance, includes elephant nose fish, which use electric sensors in their skin to detect weak electrical pulses produced by prey, and blind cave fish, which navigate using special cells that detect water pressure changes. The defense cluster includes glass catfish, whose bodies contain mirror-like guanine crystals, causing predators to see mostly reflections instead of their prey. The feeding cluster includes leeches, which inject both an anesthetic and an anticoagulant to block the pain of their bite and keep the blood flowing when they latch onto their hosts. And the locomotion cluster includes a chambered nautilus, which squirts out a jet of water to propel itself through the sea. </p> <p>The three islands in the center of the exhibit address survival tactics in extremes of water abundance and scarcity, stillness and movement, salinity and freshness, and heat and cold. In the first island, the water scarcity display is inhabited by beaded lizards and gila monsters, two experts at water conservation. Leafy and weedy seadragons drift gracefully at the other end of the island, both of which depend on large bodies of water for their survival. Between the two displays, an interactive touch surface enveloped in mist allows visitors to "wipe away" images to reveal information about organisms that have adapted to a wide range of available water conditions. The second island, which houses koi, cichlids, and jellyfish, turns the focus to water movement and salinity. Here, two more touch-responsive surfaces address adaptations to various levels of salinity and motion, while water spurts and flows across them. The third island, which puts the spotlight on temperature, includes a display of yellow perch under ice. A final touch surface allows visitors to pull up images and stories about animals that survive in a wide range of temperatures. </p> <p>Once an hour, the entire exhibit is transformed into a full-round theater, playing a five-minute video about the importance of water on the planet. A ring of ten high-resolution video projectors create a seamless, surround-view projection field along the top six feet of the Water Planet walls. The show, which is narrated by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, outlines the properties of water, its link to the origin of life on Earth, and the need to conserve this precious resource.</p> <p><b>A Novel Design and New Technologies </b></p> <p>The Water Planet exhibit was conceived by New York-based design firm Thinc, which set out to create a powerful and engaging public experience inside an exhibit that reflected the tactility and sensuality of water. To design the exhibit's innovative wall treatments and islands, they partnered with Urban A&amp;O, an architecture firm that specializes in the design and precision modeling of sophisticated forms and surfaces using CATIA-based software. The molds for the exhibit's sculpted walls were carved on a computer-guided, five-axis milling machine. The wave-inspired panels were then formed in fiberglass. </p> <p> The sinuous forms that invite touch throughout the exhibit become directly responsive in the interactive touch surfaces that are embedded in the three central islands. The imagery on these surfaces is projected from above, while water and mist play across them. Hand motion over the surfaces is tracked using camera vision, rewarding curious visitors with responsive content. </p> <p> In order to project the surround-view media presentation onto the sculpted surfaces of the Water Planet walls, the designers turned to Seventh Sense software, which is capable of merging multiple sources of projection onto compound-shaped visual fields, creating a seamless, shared experience for up to 150 people. </p> <p> The combined effect of these technologies is an immersive, interactive space that evokes a sense of wonder about the key element that makes life possible on Earth—water. </p> <p> The Water Planet exhibit is funded in part by the National Science Foundation.</p>

			<div id="pr_body">SAN FRANCISO (October 24, 2008) --- San Francisco, Mayor Gavin Newsom and Luis R. Cancel, Director of Cultural Affairs for the San Francisco Arts Commission, are pleased to dedicate a new sculpture by Maya Lin entitled <i>Where the Land Meets the Sea</i> at the California Academy of Sciences; it will be a permanent part of the City’s Civic Art Collection. The dedication will take place on Friday, October 24, at 4:00 p.m. on the West Terrace of the California Academy of Sciences. <br>&nbsp;<br>   This is the first permanent artwork by Maya Lin in San Francisco. The artist was selected through the Arts Commission’s competitive application process in 2005. Although Lin does not usually participate in competitions, she responded to the Arts Commission’s invitation to apply because of her keen interest in the California Academy of Sciences and the opportunity the project would provide to engage with the institution’s scientists. As an ardent environmentalist, Ms. Lin wished to develop a project that would make people more aware of their environment and the natural world.<br>   &nbsp;<br>   The 36’ x 60’ x 15’ sculpture is fabricated from 5/8 inch marine grade stainless steel tubing. Like a line drawing in space, the sculpture depicts the topography between Angel Island and the Golden Gate Bridge. To make the hills and valleys of the terrain more visible, the actual scale of the landscape is exaggerated by five times above sea level and by ten times below. “This piece was the culmination of a quest to reveal San Francisco Bay—to get people to think about what’s beneath the water line in a new way,” says Lin. “It took almost eight months for us to mesh the land and water data sets because the two sets of data were completely segregated—and this is the whole point! We think of these things as two separate systems even though they are literally connected to each other.” In order to build the sculpture, Lin’s fabricator, the Walla Walla Foundry, recreated the exterior West Terrace of the Academy in their warehouse to ensure precision in the attachment of the sculpture to the terrace’s six columns.<br>   &nbsp;<br>   The sculpture is installed outdoors on the Academy’s West Terrace, where it is seamlessly attached to six columns and suspended by nine thread-like steel cables from the overhead solar canopy. It seems to float like a cloud in a Chinese landscape painting against the backdrop of greenery in Golden Gate Park, a dynamic counterpoint to the formal and orderly geometry of the building’s architecture by Renzo Piano. Interpretive signage installed on a wall adjacent to the sculpture describes the section of the San Francisco Bay that is depicted in the sculpture. Arts Commission Director Luis Cancel states, “This is one of the most significant works to be acquired by the Arts Commission for the Civic Art Collection in recent years.”<br>   &nbsp;<br>   Maya Lin was selected from a candidate pool of 25 artists by a joint committee comprised of representatives from the Academy of Sciences, the Arts Commission, local museum curators and a member of the Music Concourse Citizen’s Advisory Committee. The Committee’s representatives were appointed to oversee the development of the public art program for the Academy of Sciences. Ms. Lin was chosen through a rigorous process concluding with an interview with the Advisory Committee. Although the California Academy of Sciences is a private nonprofit institution, its buildings occupy City property and a portion of the construction cost of the new building was funded with General Obligation Bonds. For this reason, the City’s Art Enrichment Ordinance was applicable and provided the funding for the project.<br>&nbsp;<br>   For a limited time, this is an unprecedented opportunity to view Maya Lin’s work on both sides of the Music Concourse in Golden Gate Park. The sculpture dedication on Friday, October 24th, is concurrent with the opening of her show entitled <i>Systematic Landscapes</i> at the de Young Museum. Following the 4:00 p.m. dedication ceremony at the Academy, visitors are invited to walk across the Music Concourse to the de Young to join Ms. Lin at a public reception for <i>Systematic Landscapes</i>. Visitors to the de Young exhibition will have the opportunity to view the development and evolution of her work for the California Academy of Sciences where her numerous renderings, small-scale models and maquettes for <i>Where the Land Meets the Sea</i> will be displayed. <i>Where the Land Meets the Sea</i> is Ms. Lin’s third sculpture in a series of wire landscapes, and the only one that is permanently installed outdoors. The two other landscapes in the series include Water Line (2006), an aluminum sculpture that represents a location just north of Antarctica, and Above and Below (2007), a 100-foot-long aluminum sculpture permanently installed at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.<br>   &nbsp;<br>   Ms. Lin’s other recent work includes <i>Pin River-Yangtze</i>, an installation of 30,000 straight pins representing the topography of the Yangtze River, in the new American Embassy in Beijing, which opened in August, 2008; and the<i> Confluence Project</i>, which was initiated in 2000 and consists of seven art installations along the Columbia River Basin commemorating the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Ms. Lin is also completing a four-acre earthwork at Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y., one of a series of wave fields sculpted from grass, sand and soil. Ms. Lin was awarded the New York Prize Senior Fellowship by the Van Alen Institute in August, 2008, to pursue advanced research and experimentation in the field of public architecture.<br>   &nbsp;<br>   The mission of the Academy to explore, explain and protect the natural world parallels the artist’s own passionate commitment to save the Earth and its natural phenomena. A second artwork for the Academy is proposed to be unveiled in 2009. Entitled <i>What is Missing?</i>, it will be a monument to extinction and will be the last of the artist’s memorials. <i>What is Missing?</i> represents both endings and beginnings, as it will be her first multimedia artwork. The project will focus on lost or endangered animals and places, and was developed through her interaction and communication with the Academy’s research scientists. <i>What is Missing?</i> will be the first in a series of future projects planned by the artist with the objective of engendering an awareness of what is missing from our lives, such as the fireflies or lightning bugs that used to delight us as children.<br>   &nbsp;<br><b>About the San Francisco Arts Commission</b><br>   Established by charter in 1932, the San Francisco Arts Commission (“SFAC”) is the City agency that champions the arts in San Francisco.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 4, 2008) - The California Academy of Sciences is pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Zeresenay Alemseged as the new Irvine Chair of Anthropology.  Alemseged joins the Academy after four years at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.  In 2006, Alemseged made an indelible mark in the field of anthropology when he reported the finding of the "world's oldest baby."  Uncovered in his native country of Ethiopia, the 3.3 million-year-old fossil of an infant <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> was the most complete skeleton of its kind ever found.  Its discovery provided new insight into the anatomical, behavioral, and developmental evolution of early human ancestors from other apes.  His work has been sponsored by the Leakey Foundation and the National Geographic Society, which named him an "emerging explorer" in 2004.</p>         <p>"Zeresenay impressed all of us who met him with his accomplishments, outstanding presentations, and strong commitment to both research and public education," said Dr. Gregory Farrington, Executive Director of the Academy. "His appointment will further strengthen the Academy's position as one of the premier scientific research institutions in the world."</p> <p>As the new Irvine Chair of Anthropology, Alemseged will oversee the Academy's 17,000 cultural artifacts collected over the past 155 years, and will expand the department's research program with his ongoing work on hominid fossil remains and their environments.

			<div id="pr_body"> <p>SAN FRANCISCO (January 13, 2009) — A visually arresting look at the impacts of climate in remote places rarely seen by most people is the focus of a new photo exhibition entitled <i>A Climate for Life: Meeting the Global Challenge</i> opening at the California Academy of Sciences on January 17. </p> <p>A collaboration of Conservation International (CI) and the International League of Conservation Photographers (ILCP), the exhibit will run through April 12, 2009. It includes more than 50 fine art prints produced on canvas using the giclée printing process. In addition to the exhibit, the Academy will host a lecture on Feb. 3 at 7 p.m. in the Herbst Forum entitled "The Art of Conservation," with ILCP Executive Director Cristina Mittermeier and CI Senior Director Michael Totten, both lead authors of the accompanying book, also entitled <i>A Climate For Life: Meeting the Global Challenge</i>. </p> <p>In the book's foreword, Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson and actor Harrison Ford state, "This is the central message of <i>A Climate for Life</i> -- the global environment cannot be stabilized and restored piece-by-piece and step-by-step. Its deterioration has to halt on all fronts, through intelligent and concerted action, with linkages to the parts given the same attention as to the parts themselves." </p> <p>The photo exhibit includes images representing a diverse global perspective of the impacts of climate change. The photographers and authors explore the issues relating to climate change, and the book presents a clear plan of action. Adoption of the recommendations that span policy, technology, and market innovations could stimulate the global economy while providing for the well-being and security of humanity. It shows that alleviating climate change can grow economies rather than stifle them. </p> <p>Some key points: </p> <ul><li>Climate destabilization poses a catastrophic long-term threat to humanity. </li></ul><ul><li>Deforestation and degradation of tropical forests each year is responsible for 20 to 25 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions (more than from all the world's cars, trucks, planes, ships and railroads combined). </li></ul><ul><li>Any effort to mitigate climate change must account for the emissions from tropical forest deforestation. </li></ul><ul><li>This book offers a range of solutions for stabilizing the world's climate right now. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The photo exhibit is made up of photos taken from the more than 175 photographs provided by ILCP for the book, including images from world-class talents including noted wildlife photographer Frans Lanting, glacier photographer James Balog, and endangered species photographer Joel Sartore. The images are a powerful compliment to the science. </p> <p>Recently featured in National Geographic, the ILCP is a non-profit organization that uses the power of the world's best photographs to help educate the world and to further conservation goals. </p> <p>"The ILCP was created to give conservation photographers the power to place their images in the court of public opinion as irrefutable evidence of the threats facing our planet and the consequences to humans, economies and ecosystems," says Cristina Mittermeier. </p> <p>The book, <i>A Climate for Life: Meeting the Global Challenge</i>, is published in partnership with CI, the ILCP and CEMEX. It is the 16th book in CEMEX's Conservation Book Series begun in 1993 to inspire and raise awareness for the conservation of nature. The books are developed in partnership with recognized global non-profits such as CI, BirdLife International, and the World Conservation Union (IUCN). </p> <p><b>About Conservation International </b><br> Conservation International (CI) applies innovations in science, economics, policy and community participation to protect the Earth's richest regions of plant and animal diversity and demonstrate that human societies can live harmoniously with nature. Founded in 1987, CI works in more than 40 countries on four continents to help people find economic alternatives without harming their natural environments.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">SAN FRANCISCO (December 1, 2009) — From December 7 – 18, 2009, the United Nations will hold the 15th annual Conference of the Parties for its Framework Convention on Climate Change. The purpose of the conference, which will take place in Copenhagen, is to assess progress and challenges in coping with global climate change, and to work toward a new protocol that will replace the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. Dr. Healy Hamilton, the director of the Center for Applied Biodiversity Informatics at the California Academy of Sciences, will be in Copenhagen to present her research about the impact of global climate change on biodiversity.<br>&nbsp;<br>  "Historically, most of the media and public attention to climate change has been focused on extreme weather events or public health consequences," says Hamilton. "There is much less awareness about the potential impacts to biological diversity and ecosystem function, probably because most people don't realize the critical role that intact natural systems play as the economic and ecological foundation to human well being."<br>&nbsp;<br>  Hamilton hopes her presentation at COP15 will encourage policy makers to consider these lesser known, but critically important, impacts of global climate change. Integrating an unprecedented amount of data from museum specimens, field biologists, and global climate models, Hamilton has been working to create a series of maps that illustrate how habitats will shift over the next 100 years in response to different levels of greenhouse gas emissions. These high-resolution maps, which project the future geographic ranges of conservation target species under different future climate scenarios on a ten by ten kilometer grid, are providing some of the first actionable data for conservation managers who must now plan for the effects of a changing climate regime.<br>&nbsp;<br>  "There are profound differences in the impacts of climate change on biodiversity depending on our future greenhouse gas emissions," says Hamilton. "When we model under pessimistic scenarios, the outcomes reveal a world so different by 2090 that the impacts will be devastating to wildlife. But if we can stabilize our emissions levels, and if we implement the right conservation measures, many more species will have a chance to adapt." <br>&nbsp;<br> At COP15, Hamilton will be presenting as part of a session she organized, entitled "Climate Change and the Diversity of Life: Towards Positive Solutions," which will take place in the U.S. Pavilion on December 15. She has invited three other speakers to join the session: Dr. Phil Duffy from Climate Central, a climate physicist with expertise in climate model downscaling; Dr. Gregory Asner from the Carnegie Institution, an expert on measuring and monitoring carbon in tropical forests; and Rick Ridgeway, a world-renowned mountain climber, author, and photographer, and the Vice President of environmental programs at Patagonia, Inc. Ridgeway is also the founder of the Freedom to Roam campaign, an international coalition of corporations, government agencies, conservation organizations, and recreation groups working together on creative solutions to the threat global warming presents to America's wildlife. During the session, the panelists will present an information rich, forward looking, solutions oriented series of talks about one of the lesser appreciated potential impacts of climate change.<br>&nbsp; <br><b>Public Programs at the California Academy of Sciences </b><br>     In conjunction with Hamilton’s presentation at COP15, the Academy will be hosting a series of climate conversations and conference updates for visitors. All programs are free with museum admission.<p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><b>Update from Copenhagen <br></b><b>Wednesday, December 16 at 10:00 am <br></b>Visit the Academy’s “Science in Action” exhibit for an update from the COP15 conference.

Panelists are: Healy Hamilton from the California Academy of Sciences; Rick Ridgeway from Patagonia’s Freedom to Roam Campaign; Greg Asner from the Carnegie Institution, and Phil Duffy from Climate Central.</p>  <b>About the COP15 Conference: </b>&nbsp;<br> The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty that took effect in 1994. The objective of the treaty, which has been ratified by 192 countries, is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human-induced interference with the global climate system. The treaty itself sets no mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and contains no enforcement mechanisms. Instead, the treaty provides for updates (called "protocols") that would set mandatory emission limits. The first of these, The Kyoto Protocol, was adopted by a subset of countries in 1997 and put into effect on February 16, 2005. To date, 184 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol.<br>&nbsp;<br> The parties to the convention have met annually since 1995 in Conferences of the Parties (COP) to assess progress in dealing with climate change. The fifteenth meeting of its kind, COP15 will take place in Copenhagen from December 7 – 18, 2009. The first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol will expire in 2012, so the UN climate chief, Yvo De Boer, hopes to establish a new protocol over the course of the next two Conferences of the Parties.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>About the California Academy of Sciences: </b><br> The California Academy of Sciences is the only institution in the world to combine a museum, aquarium, planetarium, and world-class research and education programs under one roof. This unique combination allows visitors to explore the depths of a Philippine coral reef, climb into the canopy of a Costa Rican rainforest, and fly to the outer reaches of the Universe—all in a single visit. Designed by award-winning architect Renzo Piano, the building sets a new standard for sustainable architecture and recently received the highest possible rating from the U.S. Green Building Council. It also provides a home for the Academy’s research scientists, who launch dozens of expeditions each year to document biodiversity around the world, as well as the museum’s 26 million research specimens—essential tools for comparative studies on the history and future of life on Earth.<br>&nbsp;<br><p>&nbsp;</p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">SAN FRANCISCO (November 12, 2009) —Anchored to an algae-covered rock in a 120-gallon tank at the California Academy of Sciences’ Steinhart Aquarium, a cluster of inky-colored cuttlefish eggs is beginning to swell—evidence of success for the Academy’s new captive breeding program for dwarf cuttlefish, <i>Sepia bandensis</i>. The program, pioneered by Academy biologist Richard Ross, is the first of its kind in a U.S. aquarium, and offers the Academy and other institutions the opportunity to study and display a species that is both captivating and—at 2-4 inches in length—less resource-intensive to keep than its larger relatives. “By establishing a stable breeding population,” Ross explains, “our hope is to make it easier for aquariums to showcase cuttlefish and their remarkable characteristics without impacting wild populations.” <br>&nbsp;<br>While called “cuttlefish,” these animals are actually not fish at all—they are members of the class <i>Cephalopoda</i>, which also includes octopus, squid, and the chambered nautilus. Perhaps best known for their highly developed brains, nervous systems, and eyes, cephalopods are a fascinating group of animals to both researchers and aquarium visitors. For scientists, cephalopods’ advanced capabilities pose a host of unanswered questions about the nature of intelligence in invertebrates and vertebrates. For everyday observers, the dwarf cuttlefish is a captivating ambassador to its <i>Cephalopoda</i> class, and its native Indo-Pacific region. Able to rapidly change its skin color, <i>Sepia bandensis</i> frequently flashes moving patterns across its skin, and can quickly blend into its surroundings—phenomena that can be seen regularly in the Steinhart Aquarium display. Beneath that ever-changing skin, the dwarf cuttlefish’s physiology is equally remarkable, with three hearts, and an esophagus that passes through its brain. <br>&nbsp;<br> Behind the scenes at the Academy, hundreds of tiny hatchlings—exact replicas of their adult counterparts—are being hand-fed at least twice a day. In developing the breeding program, one of the most significant challenges Ross faced was identifying a successful feeding strategy for young hatchlings in the absence of existing literature. The key, he has discovered, is that young cuttlefish require live meals beginning with mysis shrimp, and increasing in size with age. Hunting with a pair of feeding tentacles, dwarf cuttlefish can devour prey the length of their own bodies. <br>&nbsp;<br> As the eggs on display at the Academy continue to expand, they transition from an inky purple to translucent, at which point the babies can be seen swimming inside their egg casings. To date, more than 350 dwarf cuttlefish have hatched at the Academy, most of which have been sent to other aquariums and research institutions. Since North American waters do not house any native cuttlefish, only a handful of species are currently seen in zoos and aquariums in the United States. Now that these small animals are available from a sustainable captive source, Academy biologists hope that other zoos and aquariums will take advantage of the opportunity to share these intriguing animals with their visitors as well. This new captive breeding program joins several others that the Academy participates in, including those for African penguins, and golden mantella frogs, all of which are aimed at protecting populations in the wild. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b> About the Steinhart Aquarium </b><br> The California Academy of Sciences’ Steinhart Aquarium is one of the most biodiverse and interactive aquariums in the world. Home to an estimated 38,000 animals representing more than 900 separate species, it offers visitors an unprecedented view of underwater life and provides insight into the critical role that aquatic environments play in life on Earth. The original Steinhart Aquarium opened in Golden Gate Park in 1923, and today it houses a stunning new suite of exhibits, including the world’s deepest living reef tank, a four-level rainforest display, and a unique, ever-changing Water Planet exhibit. </p> <p>  <b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The California Academy of Sciences is a world-class scientific and cultural institution based in San Francisco, home to Steinhart Aquarium, Morrison Planetarium, and Kimball Natural History Museum, along with research and education programs. In 2008, the Academy opened a new LEED Platinum-rated facility, and remains the only institution in the world to combine all of those elements under one roof. Founded in 1853, the Academy is driven by a mission to explore, explain and protect the natural world.

			<div id="pr_body"> <p>  SAN FRANCISO (March 11, 2009) – Timely programs, rich exhibits, and a parkland setting make the California Academy of Sciences the ultimate place to celebrate Earth Day, and get up close and personal with the planet we call home. In April, the Academy will host a variety of talks and activities to celebrate Earth Day, including a Sustainability Fair, a brand new series of naturalist-led tours of Golden Gate Park, and hands-on science activities. All daytime programs are included with museum admission, and as always, visitors who take public transportation to the Academy can receive $3 off. </p> <p>The celebration kicks off on the weekend of April 18-19, with a Sustainability Fair, live animal demonstrations, and hands-on activities. These and other special programs will highlight steps individuals can take to lead more eco-friendly lives, and help protect fragile habitats around the world. The Academy’s exhibits provide vivid examples of the resources we need to conserve – transporting visitors to some of Earth’s most diverse ecosystems, from the coral reefs of the Philippines and the rainforests of Madagascar, to the coastal waters off of Northern California. </p> <p>Just outside the museum’s doors, Golden Gate Park is home to vibrant ecosystems of its own. The Academy is launching a series of naturalist-led tours of Stowe Lake (April 18-19) and the park’s oak woodlands (April 25-26), which will shed new light on these familiar habitats. </p> <p>For more information on living a greener life, the Academy’s Sustainability Card is available at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/sustainable_future/">www.calacademy.org/sustainable_future/</a>.

			<div id="pr_body">  <p align="center"><b>EXHIBITS </b></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>** NEW** A Climate for Life: Meeting the Global Challenge – closes in April, 2009 </b><br>   Many dramatic effects of climate change are in remote places that most people will never see. A new photo exhibition by Conservation International and the International League of Conservation Photographers attempts to bring these places to life through stunning photographs that showcase the diversity of life on Earth. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.    </i><br>&nbsp; <br><b>**COMING SOON** From Earth to the Universe: A Visible Journey through the Wonders of the Universe – opens in late April, 2009 </b><br> 2009 is the International Year of Astronomy, and with it comes a chance to explore the Universe and our place within it. This collection of astronomical images from NASA, the Hubble Space Telescope, and professional and amateur astronomers represents the incredible variety of astronomical objects that are known to exist – planets, comets, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and the clusters in which they congregate. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.  </i><br>&nbsp; <br><b>African Hall – ongoing exhibit </b><br> Take a virtual safari through Africa by exploring the majestic dioramas of African Hall. Lions and cheetahs face off with zebras and antelope through the glass windows of their detailed displays, and a lowland gorilla invites you to ponder your ancestry. Look closely as you wander through the hall—these dioramas contain a few surprises: live tortoises, lizards, and fish have taken up residence in some of the smaller displays, and African penguins dip and dive in a 25,000-gallon tank at the end of the hall. Penguin feedings take place daily at 10:30 am and 3:30 pm. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park.

Slide on your special viewing glasses and see for yourself what all the buzz is about. "Bugs!" plays hourly; show passes available on a first-come-first-served basis. <i>California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.    </i><br> &nbsp; <br><b>California Coast – ongoing exhibit </b><br>   It never rains at the Academy’s California Coast, an exhibit that highlights the state’s diverse marine environments. Watch waves roll onto a sandy beach, peek inside a 100,000-gallon rocky coast tank, and play hide-and-seek with a giant Pacific octopus. You can even hold a hermit crab at the Discovery Tidepool and meet a 165-pound sea bass in the Tank of Giants. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.    </i><br> &nbsp; <br><b>Islands of Evolution – ongoing exhibit </b><br>   Visit the remote islands of Madagascar and The Galapagos through the eyes of Academy scientists, and discover why islands function as laboratories for evolution. Examine specimens collected during Academy research expeditions, including Galapagos tortoise shells and Darwin’s famous finches. Learn how scientists search for new species, and then put your new knowledge into practice, netting virtual butterflies with Wii gaming wands and setting pit-fall traps for virtual beetles. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.    </i><br> &nbsp; <br><b>Morrison Planetarium – ongoing exhibit </b><br>   Leave Planet Earth behind as you fly to the farthest reaches of the Universe inside the world’s largest all-digital planetarium. A live presenter will take you on a guided tour of the solar system and beyond, using current data from NASA to produce the most accurate and interactive digital Universe ever created. During a visit to the international space station, you’ll gain a new perspective on your home—the only planet known to support life. "Fragile Planet" show plays hourly; show passes available on a first-come-first-served basis. <i>California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.    </i><br> &nbsp; <br><b>Philippine Coral Reef – ongoing exhibit </b><br>   Dive into the world’s deepest living coral reef tank without donning a wetsuit. Five underwater windows offer a fish’s eye view into one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. Find Nemo—and 2,000 other reef fish—darting through a technicolor forest of coral, watch garden eels emerge from their underwater burrows, and admire the brilliant hues of a giant clam. Up on the surface, follow a boardwalk through a mangrove lagoon, where sharks and rays cruise beneath your feet.<i> Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.    </i><br> &nbsp; <br><b>Rainforests of the World – ongoing exhibit </b><br>   Step inside a living rainforest, where water dripping from the mahogany and palm trees sets the beat for a symphony of croaking frogs and chirping birds. Peer into one of Borneo’s bat caves, meet chameleons from Madagascar, and climb into the tree-tops of Costa Rica, where long lines of industrious leaf cutter ants march along vines and tropical butterflies flutter like colorful confetti. Finally, descend in a glass elevator into the Amazonian flooded forest—the land of anacondas, piranhas, and electric eels. An acrylic tunnel allows you to walk beneath the Amazonian river fish that swim overhead. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park.

Part of the museum’s green building strategy, the roof provides superior insulation, prevents storm water runoff, reduces the urban heat island effect, and creates new habitat for native birds, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. An engineering marvel, the seven hills of the living roof roll over the Academy’s major exhibits and echo the hilly topography of San Francisco. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.    </i><br> &nbsp; <br><b>The Swamp – ongoing exhibit </b><br>   Peer over the bronze railing of The Swamp tank if you dare—American alligators and alligator snapping turtles rule the water below. Snakes, frogs, and salamanders live in smaller tanks nearby, and visitors can learn more during the daily Swamp Talk presentation. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park. (415) 379-8000.    </i><br> &nbsp; <br><b>Water Planet – ongoing exhibit </b><br>   What does it take to live underwater? Find out in this innovative exhibit that includes more than 100 aquarium tanks filled with fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates. Once an hour, the lights go down inside the tanks, the room transforms into a 360-degree projection theater, and visitors are immersed in a five-minute video about the most precious resource on the planet: water. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (March 1, 2010) — Every family has its share of extreme characters, and ours is no exception. For evidence, look no further than the newest exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences. <b><i>Extreme Mammals: The Biggest, Smallest, and Most Amazing Mammals of All Time</i></b> showcases some of our most intriguing relatives, from the speedy to the sloth-like, the towering to the tiny, even the venomous and the armor-clad. Featuring spectacular fossils and reconstructions alongside recent specimens and live animals, the exhibit explores the surprising and often extraordinary world of extinct and living mammals. A whale that could walk? A bat the size of a bumble bee? Mothers who are pregnant for almost two years… or just 12 days? <i>Extreme Mammals</i> will allow visitors to meet this colorful cast of characters, discover their place in the family tree, and learn why humans are perhaps the most extreme mammals of all. The exhibit opens on April 3, 2010 and runs through September 12, 2010.</p> <p>During a trip through the world of <i>Extreme Mammals</i>, visitors will learn how mammals evolved, how scientists define this group (would you have guessed one of the defining traits is the ability to eat and breathe at the same time?), and how some of the most extreme adaptations in the mammalian family support survival and reproduction. Highlights of the exhibition include taxidermy specimens—from the egg-laying platypus to the recently extinct Tasmanian wolf—as well as fleshed-out models of spectacular extinct forms, such as <i>Ambulocetus</i>, a “walking whale.” Visitors will encounter the skeletal model of <i>Puijila darwini</i>, a newly discovered extinct "walking seal" from the High Arctic with webbed feet instead of flippers; a life-size model of <i>Indricotherium</i>, the largest land mammal that ever lived; one of the oldest fossilized bats ever found; and an impressive diorama featuring the warm swamps and forests that flourished on Ellesmere Island, located in the High Arctic, about 50 million years ago.</p> <p>Another mammal featured in the exhibit, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, may look more familiar, but this big-brained, bipedal mammal has evolved several extreme features. “We don’t often think of ourselves as extreme mammals, since we don’t have long horns or venomous spurs,” said Dr. Zeresenay Alemseged, Curator of Anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences. “However, we are without a doubt one of the most extreme mammals that evolution has produced. Our brain-to-body weight ratio is higher than any other mammal on Earth, and our ability to make and use complex tools sets us apart from all other life forms. That trait has enabled us to occupy virtually all parts of our planet and even explore others.” Dr. Alemseged’s research, including his discovery of the oldest and most complete known hominin child, will be featured in a video display in the exhibit.<br><br><b><br>Exhibition Overview</b><br><i>Extreme Mammals </i>is divided into nine sections: Introduction, What is a Mammal?, What is Extreme?, Head to Tail, Reproduction, Mammals in Motion, Extreme Climates, Extreme Isolation, and Extreme Extinction. Through the use of dynamic media displays, animated computer interactives, hands-on activities, touchable fossils, casts, taxidermy specimens, and a live tree shrew, the exhibition highlights distinctive mammalian qualities and illuminates the shared ancestry that unites these diverse creatures.</p> <ul><li><b>Introduction</b>: Before entering the gallery, visitors will discover models of the largest and smallest land mammals ever found: an overwhelming <b>15-foot-tall model of <i>Indricotherium</i></b>, an ancient rhinoceros-relative that was the largest mammal to walk the Earth; and a<b> life-sized model of the extinct shrew-like <i>Batodonoides</i></b>, the smallest mammal ever documented, which weighed less than a twentieth of an ounce, or the equivalent of a dollar bill. Among living mammals, the awards for biggest and smallest go to the 200-ton blue whale, the largest animal—mammal or otherwise—ever known; and the bumblebee bat, the smallest living mammal, which is literally no bigger than a bee and as light as a dime.</li></ul><ul><li><b>What is a Mammal?</b>: Before exploring more extremes, visitors are introduced to the basics of mammal evolution and biology. There are more than 5,400 mammal species alive today, classified into 20 different groups, called orders. About 300 million years ago, the evolutionary branch of the tree of life that includes mammals split off from the branch containing reptiles. For over 130 million years, mammals lived side by side with dinosaurs. Some early mammal relatives have even been mistaken for dinosaurs, such as the <b>sail-back synapsid <i>Dimetrodon</i>, a fossil featured in this section</b>. The <b>fossilized skull of the more mammal-like <i>Cynognathus</i> </b>shows the specialized teeth of early mammal ancestors, but not all the characteristics of the living groups of mammals. To be classified as a mammal, a species must also nurse their young with milk; have three middle-ear bones; use a diaphragm for breathing; have a secondary palate that allows simultaneous eating and breathing; and maintain a warm, stable body temperature.</li></ul><ul><li><b>What is Extreme?</b>: The skeleton of <b>an opossum and a cast of a human skeleton</b> illustrate a range of combinations of "normal" and "extreme" mammalian qualities. While many opossum features are normal for mammals, like body size, the Virginia opossum's prehensile tail, which it uses like an extra limb to grasp or hang from branches is an exceptional feature. Humans are out of the ordinary with their large brain-to-body ratio and the ability to walk upright on two legs. There are a few other bipedal mammals, but they are mostly hoppers like kangaroos. Humans also have some normal features compared to other mammals, such as three middle ear bones and five digits on each hand and foot.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Head to Tail</b>: Horns, tusks, noses, brains, body armor, and tails have come a long way in the evolutionary history of mammals. The purposes of these traits may include self-defense, recognizing kin, or attracting mates. For example, the Indonesian <b>babirusa pig</b> uses teeth that grow through the bones and skin of the top of its snout for display and fighting. The <b>complete fossil skeleton of a glyptodont </b>shows how this car-sized armadillo-relative was covered with a thick, bony shell, or carapace, to protect itself from large predators. The <b>life-sized model of <i>Macrauchenia</i> </b>features a camel-like body, giraffe-like neck, and elephant-trunk-like nose. While a specimen with a preserved nose has never been found—<i>Macrauchenia</i> went extinct 10,000 years ago—the reconstruction of its unusual trunk is based on skull features found in mammals with similar specialized noses and a comparison of early and later members of the same group. </li></ul><ul><li><b>Reproduction</b>: Giving birth to live, well-developed offspring is “normal” for most mammals, but more than 300 species of living extreme mammals do things differently. Monotremes (mammals that lay eggs) and marsupials (mammals that give birth to very immature offspring and often have pouches) are each extraordinary when it comes to reproduction and far removed from the more common placental mammals, which have babies that develop for a long period within the womb. Just a handful of mammals lay eggs, including the <b>platypus and echidnas</b> <b>featured</b> in this section. However, egg-laying is the norm in other vertebrate groups like birds, reptiles, and amphibians. This section of the exhibit is also home to <b>a live tree shrew (<i>Tupaia belangeri</i>)</b>, a species that has evolved an unusual system of maternal care. After giving birth to tiny, blind babies, mother tree shrews spend only 25 minutes with their young during the first four weeks of their life. Most likely an anti-predator adaptation, this strategy minimizes the risk that a predator will follow the mother back to her nest. Once the young leave the nest, the mother becomes a more doting parent. </li></ul><ul><li><b>Mammals in Motion</b>: Whether they move around on land, in water, or by air, mammals have developed amazing features to get from one place to another. The <b>skeleton of the <i>Glossotherium myloides</i></b>, an extinct ground sloth from South America that was a slow-moving knuckle walker, shows how gigantic these mammals could grow to be. About 50 million years ago, some groups of mammals began to shift from land to ocean life. A <b>life-size relief model of <i>Ambulocetus natans</i>, the extinct “walking whale,”</b> vividly depicts a transitional form between modern-day whales and their extinct land-dwelling ancestors. <b>The cast of the skull and partial skeleton of <i>Puijila darwini</i></b>, or “walking seal,” has otter-like limbs and a seal-like head. Discovered in the High Arctic in 2007, scientists have described <i>Puijila darwini </i>as another example of a transitional fossil—a missing link in the evolution of pinnipeds, the group that includes today’s seals, sea lions, and walruses. A few mammals glide through the air, such as lemurs and squirrels, but only bats can truly fly. <b><i>Onychonycteris finneyi</i>, a spectacular 52-million-year-old bat fossil on display</b>, represents the most primitive bat species known to date and demonstrates that these animals evolved the ability to fly before they could echolocate, or detect objects by emitting sounds and gauging their reflections. Of the more than 5,400 species of mammals that exist today, over 1,100 are bats.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Extreme Climates: A large-scale, intricately detailed diorama of Ellesmere Island</b>, located 600 miles from the North Pole, provides an insightful glimpse of this area 50 million years ago. At that time, the Earth was significantly warmer and Ellesmere Island was covered mostly with forests. This reconstruction shows a warm, humid, and swamp-like forest, vastly different from the bitter-cold Arctic of today, which was home to a variety of mammals. Among the models of extinct mammals in the diorama are <b><i>Vulpavus</i></b>, a carnivore with a long, thin body and tail that were well suited for quick movements both in trees and on the ground; <i><b>Coryphodon</b></i>, a short-tusked hippo-like wader; and <i><b>Thuliadanta</b></i>, an extinct tapir that had a flexible, trunk-like snout. In contrast to the lush vegetation and diverse mammals 50 million years ago, today’s Ellesmere Island is home to plants that are only a few inches tall and fewer than a dozen species of land mammals, including musk ox, caribou, polar bear, and arctic hare. </li></ul><ul><li><b>Extreme Isolation</b>: Madagascar, Australia, and South America existed as isolated islands and continents for tens of millions of years, leading to the evolution of an incredible diversity of mammals found nowhere else on Earth. Impressive <b>fossils of the extinct hoofed plant-eaters <i>Scarrittia</i> and <i>Astrapotherium</i></b> illustrate the concept of convergent evolution, the appearance of similar features in distantly related organisms living in similar environments. While <i>Scarrittia</i> looked like a rhino or horse, it was not closely related to either. <i>Astrapotherium</i> developed large tusks and a long trunk, but was not closely related to elephants found on other continents.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Extreme Extinction</b>: Mass extinctions, or the rapid loss of a great number of species, have happened at least five times over the past 500 million years, and a sixth appears to be occurring today. Climate change, hunting by humans, a crashing comet, and the introduction of new diseases are some of the drivers that may have been behind the permanent disappearance of many large mammalian species about 12,000 years ago. Today, human-caused environmental changes and habitat loss threaten more species. The remarkable <b>fossil skulls and skeletons of <i>Smilodon fatalis</i></b>, a massive saber-toothed cat, and <b><i>Canis dirus</i></b>, the dire wolf, are on display in this area. Both species roamed North America and died out at the end of the last Ice Age. A <b>taxidermy specimen of one of the last-known Tasmanian wolves</b> (also known as Tasmanian tigers) is also on view. After intense hunting, the species went completely extinct as recently as the mid-1930s. Remarkably, even with 25 percent of living species of mammals on the brink of extinction, scientists are still discovering new species. In 2008, Academy research associate Galen Rathbun discovered <b>a new species of sengi </b>that lives only in two high-altitude forest blocks in the mountains of Tanzania—a study skull of this rare animal is on display in the exhibit. Sengis are monogamous mammals found only in Africa that have a colorful history of misunderstood ancestry. Like shrews, these small, furry mammals eat mostly insects. Early scientists named them elephant-shrews not because they thought the animals were related to elephants but because of their long, flexible snouts. Ironically, recent molecular research has shown that they are actually more closely related to elephants than to shrews. Members of a supercohort called Afrotheria that evolved in Africa over 100 million years ago, their relatives include elephants, sea cows, and the aardvark. “This is one of the most exciting discoveries of my career,” said Rathbun, who has studied the ecology, social structure, and evolution of sengis for more than 30 years. “It is the first new species of giant sengi to be discovered in more than 126 years. From the moment I first lifted one of the animals into our photography tent, I knew it must be a new species—not just because of its distinct coloring, but because it was so heavy!” The new species, which has been named the grey-faced sengi (<i>Rhynchocyon udzungwensis</i>), weighs about 700 grams (1.5 pounds), which is more than 25 percent larger than any other known sengi.</li></ul><p><b><br>Extreme Life</b><br>   Mammals aren’t the only animals with extreme adaptations.

			<div id="pr_body"> <p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 27, 2009) – Just in time for the first annual World Oceans Day, the first ever webcam on the Farallon National Wildlife Refuge will go live on June 8 at www.calacademy.org/webcams/farallones. Powered by solar energy and perched on a windswept lighthouse on top of Southeast Farallon Island, the webcam will provide an unprecedented view of the seabirds, seals, and possibly even sharks that call these isolated islands home. The live webcam feed will be accompanied by animal identification guides, Farallones history, and research and conservation information.  This exciting new initiative is made possible through a cooperative partnership between the California Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and PRBO Conservation Science.</p> <p>Located 27 miles west of San Francisco, the Farallon National Wildlife Refuge is composed of three island groups that are home to the largest seabird colony in the continental United States. Approximately 250,000 seabirds representing 13 species and five species of seals and sea lions use the islands.  Gray whales, blue whales, and humpback whales migrate past the islands every year. The area is also an important feeding ground for great white sharks.  The refuge was established in 1909 by President Theodore Roosevelt as a preserve and breeding ground for native birds.</p>   <p>"Since the islands are not accessible to the general public, the webcam will be a valuable tool not only for scientists, but for casual observers as well," says Dr. Jack Dumbacher, curator of ornithology &amp; mammalogy at the California Academy of Sciences and lead scientist on the project. "The wildlife observations that we glean from this webcam will assist with ongoing research, guide conservation decisions, and hopefully inspire citizens to care about this valuable resource right in San Francisco's backyard."</p> <p>Over 40 years of data on Farallon wildlife have been collected by PRBO Conservation Science in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  The findings of these long-term studies have assisted with the establishment of the adjacent Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, contributed to state laws that protect white sharks and restrict use of commercial gill nets, and provided a greater understanding of marine ecosystem conservation.</p>  <p>"The Farallon Islands are California's Galapagos - truly a jewel of the SF Bay Area that supports an amazing abundance of seabirds, seals, sea lions and sharks," says Ellie M. Cohen, President and CEO of PRBO Conservation Science. "We are thrilled to bring PRBO's 24/7 research and stewardship on this rocky laboratory to the public through this new website."</p>   <p>The webcam is an Axis 233D network dome camera with half hi-definition resolution.  It beams image data via a microwave link between the Southeast Farallon Island and San Francisco's Twin Peaks.  The pan, tilt, and zoom features of the camera will provide 360-degree views of the island.  Network infrastructure for the webcam was provided by the City and County of San Francisco's Department of Technology.</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth's living things. The Academy has a staff of over 50 professional educators and Ph.D.-level scientists, supported by more than 100 Research and Field Associates and over 300 Fellows.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 21, 2009) — New species are not just discovered in exotic locales—even places as urban as California still yield discoveries of new plants and animals. Academy scientists recently named a new species of chimaera, an ancient and bizarre group of fishes distantly related to sharks, from the coast of Southern California and Baja California, Mexico. The new species, the Eastern Pacific black ghostshark (<i>Hydrolagus melanophasma</i>), was described in the September issue of the international journal <i>Zootaxa</i> by a research team including Academy Research Associates David Ebert (also with Moss Landing Marine Laboratories) and Douglas J. Long (also with the Oakland Museum of California). Additional co-authors included Kelsey James, a graduate student at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and Dominique Didier from Millersville University in Pennsylvania. This is the first new species of cartilaginous fish to be described from California waters since 1947. <br>    &nbsp;<br>   Chimaeras, also called ratfish, rabbitfish, and ghostsharks, are perhaps the oldest and most enigmatic groups of fishes alive today. Their closest living relatives are sharks, but their evolutionary lineage branched off from sharks nearly 400 million years ago, and they have remained an isolated group ever since. Like sharks, chimaeras have skeletons composed of cartilage and the males have claspers for internal fertilization of females. Unlike sharks, male chimaeras also have retractable sexual appendages on the forehead and in front of the pelvic fins and a single pair of gills. Most species also have a mildly venomous spine in front of the dorsal fin. Chimaeras were once a very diverse and abundant group, as illustrated by their global presence in the fossil record. They survived through the age of dinosaurs mostly unchanged, but today these fishes are relatively scarce and are usually confined to deep ocean waters, where they have largely avoided the reach of explorers and remained poorly known to science.<br> &nbsp;<br>   This new species belongs to the genus <i>Hydrolagus</i>, Latin for ‘water rabbit’ because of its grinding tooth plates reminiscent of a rabbit’s incisor teeth. This new species was originally collected as early as the mid 1960s, but went unnamed until this year because its taxonomic relationships were unclear. A large blackish-purple form, <i>Hydrolagus melanophasma </i>(<i>melanophasma</i> is Latin for ‘black ghost’), is found in deep water from the coast of Southern California, along the western coast of Baja California, and into the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California). This species is known from a total of nine preserved museum specimens, and from video footage taken of it alive by a deep-water submersible in the Sea of Cortez.<br>    &nbsp;<br>   Renewed exploration of the world’s deep oceans and more extensive taxonomic analysis of chimaera specimens in museum collections have led to a boom in the number of new chimaera species discovered worldwide in the last decade, including two species from the Galápagos Islands named by Didier, Ebert, and Long in 2006 that were originally collected by Academy scientist John McCosker. With further advances in research and discovery, perhaps more will be known about these living fossils and their diversity in the world’s oceans.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br>    &nbsp;<br>   The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 18, 2009) — From beetles to barnacles, pikas to pine warblers, many species are already on the move in response to shifting climate regimes. But how fast will they - and their habitats - have to move to keep pace with global climate change over the next century? In a new study, a team of scientists including Dr. Healy Hamilton from the California Academy of Sciences have calculated that on average, ecosystems will need to shift about 0.42 kilometers per year (about a quarter mile per year) to keep pace with changing temperatures across the globe. Mountainous habitats will be able to move more slowly, since a modest move up or down slope can result in a large change in temperature. However, flatter ecosystems, such as flooded grasslands, mangroves, and deserts, will need to move much more rapidly to stay in their comfort zone - sometimes more than a kilometer per year. The team, which also included scientists from the Carnegie Institute of Science, Climate Central, and U.C. Berkeley, will publish their results in the December 24 issue of <i>Nature</i>.</p>   <p>"One of the most powerful aspects of this data is that it allows us to evaluate how our current protected area network will perform as we attempt to conserve biodiversity in the face of global climate change," says Healy Hamilton, Director of the Center for Applied Biodiversity Informatics at the California Academy of Sciences. "When we look at residence times for protected areas, which we define as the amount of time it will take current climate conditions to move across and out of a given protected area, only 8% of our current protected areas have residence times of more than 100 years. If we want to improve these numbers, we need to both reduce our carbon emissions and work quickly toward expanding and connecting our global network of protected areas."</p> <p>The team calculated the velocity of global climate change by combining data on current climate and temperature regimes worldwide with a large suite of climate model projections for the next century. Their calculations are based on an "intermediate" level of projected greenhouse gas emissions over the next century (the A1B emissions scenario from The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).  Under these emissions levels, the velocity of climate change is projected to be the slowest in tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 kilometers per year), temperate coniferous forests (0.11 kilometers per year), and montane grasslands and shrublands (0.11 kilometers per year). The velocity of climate change is expected to be the fastest in flatter areas, including deserts and xeric shrublands (0.71 kilometers per year), mangroves (0.95 kilometers per year), and flooded grasslands and savannas (1.26 kilometers per year).</p> <p>The vulnerability of these respective biomes depends not only on the average velocity of climate change they will experience, but also on the sizes of the protected areas in which they are found.  For instance, while the velocity of climate change is expected to be high in deserts, this threat is mediated by the fact that protected areas for deserts tend to be larger. On the other hand, the small size and fragmented nature of most protected areas in Mediterranean temperate broadleaf and boreal forest biomes make these habitats particularly vulnerable.</p>   <p>What does this mean for beetles, barnacles, and other groups of species? The researchers note that their index estimates the velocities and residence times of climates, not species. Individual species that have a wide tolerance for a range of temperatures may be able to adapt in place as the climate around them shifts. However, for species that can only tolerate a narrow band of temperatures, the velocity estimates in the study are a close approximation for the migration speeds needed to potentially avoid extinction. Nearly a third of the habitats in the study have velocities higher than even the most optimistic plant migration estimates, suggesting that plants in many areas will not be able to keep up with the shifting climate. Even more problematic is the fact that natural habitats have been extensively fragmented by human development, which will leave many species with "nowhere to go," regardless of their migration rates.</p> <p>The team's results not only underscore the importance of lowering greenhouse gas emissions - they also provide data for conservation managers who must now plan for the impact of global climate change. The research was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project.</p> <p> <b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth's living things.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 13, 2009) — The California Academy of Sciences and Hawkes Ocean Technologies are pleased to announce that the Deep Flight Super Falcon submersible was unveiled today at the Academy, where it will be on public display through Sunday, May 17, 2009. Deep Flight Super Falcon is the newest and most advanced winged submersible designed and built by renowned engineer, Graham Hawkes. With its unique ability for underwater flight, enabling unprecedented range, speed and maneuverability, Super Falcon offers exotic new capabilities to explore one of the least understood parts of our planet. Hawkes will speak about his newest submersible at the Academy's NightLife event on Thursday, May 14.</p> <p>With the Deep Flight submersibles, Hawkes has made the same transition sub-sea that the Wright Brothers did in air, transitioning from ballooning to fixed wing aircraft. Deep Flight Super Falcon is the culmination of four generations of experimental prototype winged submersibles that have succeeded in proving the concept of underwater flight, and introducing the next generation of ultra-lightweight manned vehicles that can access the oceans at all depths.</p>  <p>The Super Falcon is the first production-model winged submersible, and was originally commissioned by venture capitalist Tom Perkins for his yacht S/Y Maltese Falcon. "When I was looking for a submersible, I wanted a fighter jet, not a blimp," said Perkins. "The Super Falcon is a resounding success and has exceeded my expectations. I believe the Super Falcon is the future for underwater adventuring."</p> <p>Graham Hawkes stated, "After twenty years of prototyping, Super Falcon is our most advanced and elegant submersible yet, encompassing all the innovations we made in introducing underwater flight from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. We look forward to working with scientists and explorers to promote a new era of ocean exploration and conservation. We're also looking forward to bringing the public down on sub-sea excursions with our Flight School and VIP in the Sea programs."</p> <p>One of the first projects for Super Falcon is the launch of VIP in the Sea, a program created by Hawkes Ocean Technologies and NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries to enable communicators - scientists, politicians, policymakers, educators and artists - to experience the oceans as never before, bringing them on flights beneath the sea. The program’s goal is to allow VIPs to experience the oceans first-hand, thereby making that critical personal connection that is the necessary first step in promoting education, exploration and preservation of our ocean planet. The first VIP dives are scheduled for this summer in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</p> <p>"We are very excited to help launch VIP in the Sea," says William J. Douros, West Coast Regional Director of NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. "It is an excellent way to showcase our national marine sanctuaries and call attention to the need to conserve and protect our ocean territories. Until now, the technology was not available to take VIPs safely and comfortably into the deeper parts of the oceans. We see Super Falcon as an Ambassador to the Seas."</p> <p>Dr. John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, will be among the first participants in the VIP in the Sea program. "I eagerly await my flight in the Super Falcon," says McCosker, who has conducted submersible-based research in such exotic locales as the Galapagos Islands and Costa Rica’s Cocos Island. "Quiet and stealthy, fast and maneuverable, I can imagine many unique applications for Super Falcon to ocean science." Submersible-based research has allowed McCosker to discover previously unknown sharks, eels, skates, scorpionfishes, and many other denizens of the deep.</p> &nbsp;<br><p><b>Calendar Editors please note:</b><br> &nbsp;<br><b>THURSDAY, MAY 14<br> NightLife, featuring Graham Hawkes and the Super Falcon Submersible<br> Overall event: 6:00 – 10:00 pm<br> Lecture: 7:30 pm</b><br> Every Thursday night, the Academy opens its doors from 6-10 pm for NightLife, a chance for adults to explore the museum in a whole new light.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">SAN FRANCISCO (December 1, 2009) — California Academy of Sciences Executive Director Greg Farrington, Ph.D., has announced that Janet Harris will join the Academy as Chief Development Officer in January 2010. Harris is currently the Vice President of Development for the International Rescue Committee, the United Nation’s largest partner on all matters relating to refugees and displaced persons. "Janet comes to the Academy with an outstanding record of accomplishment at the International Rescue Committee in New York," said Farrington. "She was attracted to us—as we were to her—because we share a deep commitment to the Academy’s causes: science, education, and the sustainability of life on Earth." Harris will oversee the Academy’s efforts to support not only its public facility in Golden Gate Park, but also its world-class scientific research and education programs.<br>&nbsp;<br>   At the International Rescue Committee, Harris was responsible for raising more than $50 million in operating income and $11 million in non-operating support each year. Over the course of her nine years with the organization, she more than tripled the number of major donors and the amount of their contributions. She also spearheaded a $110-million capital campaign for a new endowment fund. Additionally, as a member of the IRC’s senior staff, Harris helped to set the strategic direction for the organization, which operates in more than 40 countries around the world and resettles refugees in 22 cities across the United States, including San Francisco. <br>&nbsp;<br>   Prior to her experience at the International Rescue Committee, Harris served as a development and planning consultant for a number of non-profit clients, including the Roundabout Theatre Company, the James Beard Foundation, and the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. She will join the California Academy of Sciences on January 1, 2010.

			<div id="pr_header"><b><b>BIOGRAPHY OF </b>MAYA LIN<br><br></b>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">  Maya Lin has maintained a careful balance in her career between art and architecture, creating a remarkable body of work that includes large-scale site-specific installations, intimate studio artworks, and architectural works.<br>&nbsp;<br> In her large-scale environmental artworks, she has consistently explored how we experience and relate to the landscape. From her recent works such as <i>Storm King Wavefield</i> (2009, seven undulating hills of earth and grass that give the appearance of ocean waves), <i>Where the Land Meets the Sea</i> (2008, a drawing in space based upon the topology of the San Francisco Bay) and <i>Eleven Minute Line</i> (2004, an earthen line 1600 feet long by 12 feet high, traversing a meadow in Sweden) back to her very first—the <i>Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial</i>, where she cut open the land and polished its edges to create a history embedded in the earth—she has made works that merge completely with the terrain, blurring the boundaries between two- and three-dimensional space and setting up a systematic ordering of the land that is tied to history, time, and language.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her studio artwork has been shown in solo museum exhibitions in the US, Italy, Denmark, and Sweden. The exhibition <i>Maya Lin: Systematic Landscapes</i>, which opened at Seattle’s Henry Art Gallery, is the first to translate the scale and coherence of her outdoor installations to the interior space of a museum. <i>Three Ways to See the Earth: Selections from Systematic Landscapes</i> is currently showing at PaceWildenstein in New York City.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ms. Lin’s architectural works have been critically acclaimed both nationally and internationally. Her recent architecture includes the Museum of Chinese in America, opening September 22, 2009 in Chinatown, New York City, the Riggio-Lynch Chapel and Langston Hughes Library for the Children’s Defense Fund, an Environmental Learning lab at Manhattanville College, and a private residence in Colorado that was honored as one of Architecture Record’s Record Houses in 2006.<br>&nbsp;<br> A committed environmentalist, Lin has consistently focused on environmental issues and concerns- promoting sustainable building design in her architectural works while in her artworks asking us to pay closer attention to the natural world. Her last memorial, entitled <i>What is Missing?</i>, which focuses on extinct and endangered species and places, debuts at the California Academy of Sciences on September 17, 2009, with a debut in China on September 19 at the Beijing Center for the Arts, and a global debut on Earth Day 2010.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maya Lin received BA from Yale in 1981 and her Master of Architecture from Yale University in 1986, and has maintained a professional studio in New York City since then. Lin is represented by PaceWildenstein Gallery in New York. She currently serves on the Board of Trustees of the Natural Resources Defense Council and is a member of the Yale Corporation. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Presidential Design Award, an AIA Honor Award, the Finn Juhl Prize, and honorary doctorates from among others, Yale, Harvard, Williams College, and Smith College. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 2005 was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame. She has been profiled in Time Magazine, The New York Times Magazine and The New Yorker and her architecture and artworks have consistently elicited praise in magazines ranging from Newsweek to Art in America to Architectural Record. In 1996, a documentary about her work, <i>Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision</i> won the Academy Award for Best Documentary. She lives in New York City with her husband, Daniel Wolf, and their two children.<br><p>&nbsp;</p>

			<div id="pr_body"> <p>SAN FRANCISCO (March 3, 2009) — The new California Academy of Sciences celebrated the arrival of its one millionth visitor on Tuesday. Jared Miller, 8, and his grandfather Ed Miller of Elk Grove, California, were greeted by Academy Executive Director Greg Farrington and a hundred staff members upon entering the front lobby.

Attendance has been running 50% above projections, and it hit the 1,000,000 mark over two months faster than expected.</p> <p>"The level of interest and support from both the local community and tourists has been inspiring," said Farrington.  "This attendance milestone is a testament to the love people have for the Academy, and their commitment to its mission to explore the wonders of life and its sustainability."</p> <p>When asked what he was most looking forward to seeing at the Academy, Jared Miller said, "Penguins and snakes!"</p> <p><br><b>***High-resolution photos and video of the event are available.

The sculpture is part of Lin’s last memorial and is the international debut of the first component of a multi-sited, multimedia artwork dedicated to raising awareness about the current crisis surrounding biodiversity and habitat loss. Rethinking the traditional stationary monument, "What is Missing?" is a memorial that will exist in several media and in multiple places simultaneously. The permanent site-specific "What is Missing?" sculpture, installed at the Academy’s East Terrace, is part of a larger commission awarded to the artist by the Arts Commission that includes "Where the Land Meets the Sea", which was unveiled last September to correspond with the opening of the Academy’s new facility designed by architect Renzo Piano. The dedication of "What is Missing?" coincides with the Academy’s one-year anniversary in the new building. The Academy is the only institution in the world to house two permanent sculptures—an artwork and a memorial—by Lin.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Press Preview: Today, September 17, 9-10:30 a.m. at the California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, San Francisco, CA. </b><br>&nbsp;<br> " 'What is Missing?' is a poignant reminder of what we stand to lose if the crisis surrounding biodiversity and habitat loss continues,” said Mayor Newsom. “Maya Lin’s sculpture shows what is at stake and why reducing our environmental impact is one of our most urgent challenges. By making significant changes in our daily lives, such as driving less, recycling more or supporting sustainable food production, we can stem global warming and protect endangered species for generations to come.”<br>&nbsp;<br> The permanent "What is Missing?" sculpture consists of a 8'6"h x 10'8"w x 19'2"l bronze “Listening Cone” lined with reclaimed wood. A 2' 4 ¼"h x 4'6"w screen, located within the cone, features more than 20 minutes of compelling video footage that links extinct as well as threatened and endangered species to the habitats and ecosystems that are vital to their survival. The featured species, which include the tuna, dodo bird, monarch butterfly, golden toad, and others, were selected because they are either already extinct or will most likely disappear in our lifetime. The video footage is overlayed with text describing the decline of the featured species and the alarming degradation of their habitats. The text connects the viewer to the main causes of extinction—direct harvesting, non-sustainable hunting and fishing practices, the introduction of non-native species, habitat destruction and global climate change.<br>&nbsp;<br> A dedicated environmentalist, Lin has been committed to focusing attention on the natural world throughout her career, and has incorporated sustainable and recycled materials into many of her artworks. “"What is Missing?" is both a wake-up call and a call to action,” says Lin. “Underscoring the Academy’s drive to protect the natural world through education and research, the work shows what is being done by research and conservation organizations to address the crisis, as well as what individuals can do in their everyday lives to make a difference. I believe that art, at times, can look at a subject differently, and in doing so can get people to pay closer attention.”<br>&nbsp;<br> “Maya Lin’s sculpture blends art and activism by providing a tangible, aesthetic experience that articulates her environmental mission and engages the public in a dialogue about critical ecological issues,” stated Luis R. Cancel, Director of Cultural Affairs for the SFAC. “The dedication of "What is Missing?" marks an incredible achievement for the Arts Commission’s 40-year-old Public Art Program. With the sculpture’s addition to the Civic Art Collection, San Francisco will be home not only to Lin’s last memorial, but also her first multimedia artwork.”<br>&nbsp;<br> Lin spent years researching the subject matter for the project and developing the appropriate visual expression for the work. Throughout the project, she received support from numerous organizations around the country, including the California Academy of Sciences, as well as Conservation International, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, National Geographic Society, and ARKive, who donated the video and audio recordings. Panthera, National Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy, Wildlife Conservation Society and World Wildlife Fund, among others, contributed research assistance. The media illustrates the alarming depletion of animals and places from our lives—from the sheer abundance of species to the loss of migratory corridors, from the diminished visibility of the stars at night to the vanishing sounds of songbirds.<br>&nbsp;<br> The setting for "What is Missing?" is in itself a part of the memorial’s story. Scientists at the California Academy of Sciences have been exploring and documenting biodiversity for more than 155 years, and the museum’s exhibits highlight some of the planet’s most unusual and endangered life forms. “"What is Missing?" reflects the Academy’s mission to explore, explain and protect the natural world,” says Greg Farrington, Executive Director of the California Academy of Sciences. “The memorial is a wonderful complement to the research and education underway at the Academy. Along with Lin’s "Where the Land Meets the Sea", it will help engage people with the question of how we will sustain life on Earth, a theme that runs throughout the institution.”<br>&nbsp;<br> In developing "What is Missing?", Lin spent multiple visits over a 4-year period talking with Academy researchers about the stories behind various extinctions and dwindling populations. Several of the fragile locales that were selected have been destinations for Academy research expeditions for decades. Data collected on such expeditions is used to better understand historical and existing levels of biodiversity, and to model future scenarios. The Academy’s Center for Biodiversity Research is developing high-resolution maps to do just that, projecting the future ranges of key species under different climate scenarios on a ten by ten kilometer grid. These maps, and other Academy research projects, are providing some of the first actionable data for conservation managers who must now plan for the impact of global climate change.<br>&nbsp;<br> The second component of the "What is Missing?" memorial is a traveling dark room with projected images and sounds from a variety of endangered species. Visitors are encouraged to navigate through the space with translucent screens that capture images and brief statements when held over the floor projections. This portion of the project will debut at the Beijing Center for the Arts on September 19 during their "Shan Shui" exhibition. The United States debut of the dark room component will take place at the Storm King Art Center during Climate Week NYC (September 21-25). Subsequent site-specific installations, including a video that will appear on MTV’s electronic billboard in Times Square sponsored by Creative Time, and the "What is Missing?" website will launch around Earth Day 2010. <br> &nbsp;<br> For this Arts Commission project, Maya Lin was selected from a candidate pool of 25 artists by a joint committee composed of representatives from the California Academy of Sciences, the Arts Commission, local museum curators and the Music Concourse Citizens’ Advisory Committee. The committee representatives were appointed to oversee the development of the public art program for the new Academy. Lin was chosen through a rigorous process concluding with an interview with the Advisory Committee. Although the California Academy of Sciences is a private nonprofit institution, its buildings occupy City property and a portion of the construction cost of the new building was funded with General Obligation Bonds. For this reason, the City’s Art Enrichment Ordinance was applicable and provided the funding for the project and the project was arranged by the San Francisco Arts Commission. <br>&nbsp;<br> "What is Missing?" was made possible by the Public Art Program of the San Francisco Arts Commission, the California Academy of Sciences and Webcor, with additional support from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, The Betsy and Jesse Fink Foundation, Creative Time, ARKive, World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife Conservation Society, The Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, IUCN, The National Geographic Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oceana, Panthera, The Rockefeller Foundation, and Van Alen Institute. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>About the San Francisco Arts Commission and the Public Art Program</b><br>   Established by charter in 1932, the San Francisco Arts Commission is the City agency that champions the arts in San Francisco.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 15, 2009) – It's two inches long, grows on wood, and is shaped like a phallus. A new species of stinkhorn mushroom, <i>Phallus drewesii</i>, has been discovered on the African island of Sao Tome and graces the upcoming cover of the journal <i>Mycologia</i>.  The mushroom is named after Robert Drewes, Curator of Herpetology at the California Academy of Sciences, and is described in the July/August issue by Professor Dennis Desjardin and Brian Perry of San Francisco State University.</p> <p><i>Phallus drewesii</i> belongs to a group of mushrooms known as stinkhorns which give off a foul, rotting meat odor.  There are 28 other species of <i>Phallus</i> fungi worldwide, but this particular species is notable for its small size, white net-like stem, and brown spore-covered head. It is also the only <i>Phallus</i> species to curve downward instead of upward.</p>  <p>"The mushroom emerges from an egg and elongates over four hours," says Desjardin, who is also a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences. "Its odor attracts flies who consume the spores and disperse them throughout the forest."</p> <p>Desjardin and Perry named the new species after Drewes as an acknowledgment of his "inspiration and fortitude to initiate, coordinate and lead multiorganism biotic surveys on Sao Tome and Principe," according to the <i>Mycologia</i> paper.</p> <p>"It’s a wonderful honor and great fun to have this phallus-shaped fungus named after me," says Drewes. "I have been immortalized in the scientific record."</p> <p><i>Phallus drewesii</i> is not the first species to bear Drewes' name.  A small moss frog native to South Africa (<i>Arthroleptella drewesii</i>) and a blind worm snake from Kenya (<i>Leptotyphlops drewesi</i>) were described in 1994 and 1996, respectively.</p>   <p>Over a span of forty years, Drewes has embarked on 36 expeditions to 19 African countries, where he has focused on the evolutionary relationships, natural history, and biogeography of amphibians and reptiles.  Recently, he has turned his attention to Sao Tome and Principe, located in the Gulf of Guinea off Africa's west coast. Although it is a tiny nation - at 370 square miles, only about eight times the size of San Francisco - it hosts a number of plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians found nowhere else on Earth.  Since 2001, Drewes has organized four multidisciplinary expeditions to the islands in an effort to document their biodiversity and gather data for conservation plans.  <i>Phallus drewesii</i> was one of 225 fungus species that Desjardin and Perry collected during the 2006 and 2008 expeditions.</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth's living things.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 14, 2009) – In 2009, researchers at the California Academy of Sciences added 94 new relatives to our family tree.  The new species include 65 arthropods, 14 plants, eight fishes, five sea slugs, one coral, and one fossil mammal.  They were described by two dozen Academy scientists along with several dozen international collaborators.</p>  <p>Proving that there are still plenty of places to explore and things to discover on Earth, the scientists made their finds over four continents and two oceans, climbed to the tops of mountains and descended to the bottom of the sea, looked in their owns backyards (Yosemite National Park) and on the other side of the world (Yunnan Province, China).  Their results, published in 29 different scientific papers, add to the record of life on Earth and will inform future studies on biodiversity, evolution, and conservation.</p> <p>"Humans rely on healthy ecosystems, made up of organisms and their environments," says Dr. David Mindell, Dean of Science and Research Collections at the Academy. "Creating a comprehensive inventory of life on our planet is critical for understanding and managing resources.  Yet a great many life-forms remain to be discovered and described.  The effort to determine the genealogical links among all life-forms, and describe their distributions, allows biologists to assess the relative distinctiveness of groups of organisms and various geographic regions, and helps determine conservation priorities."</p> <p>One recent example of a comprehensive species inventory informing conservation priorities appeared in the April 11, 2008 issue of <i>Science</i>. Academy curator Brian Fisher and his colleagues proposed sites for new protected areas on Madagascar, using distribution data amassed over ten years from 2,315 species of ants, butterflies, frogs, geckos, lemurs, and plants.  The study was intended to help the government of Madagascar, which is in the midst of increasing its protected-area network from 5 million to 15 million acres.  The team's recommendation, which preserves all 2,315 species, provides a model for making conservation decisions in other biodiversity hotspots around the world.</p> <p>Below are a few highlights among the 94 species described by Academy scientists this year.  For a full list of species, including geographic information, click <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2009/new_species_list.php">here</a>.</p> <p><b>Denizens of the Deep</b><br> The deep sea is often described as Earth's last frontier, so it is not surprising that several new species on the list were collected in the cold, dark depths of the ocean via submersible, Remote Operated Vehicles, and deep-sea trawls.  These include three grenadier fishes (<i>Coelorinchus fuscigulus</i>, <i>C. obscuratus</i>, and <i>C. osipullus</i>); two <i>Bellottia </i>fishes (<i>B. cryptica</i> and <i>B. robusta</i>); the enigmatic black "ghostshark" which has sexual appendages on its forehead (<i>Hydrolagus melanophasma</i>); and a deep-sea coral (<i>Gersemia juliepackardae</i>) named after Julie Packard, for her dedication to ocean stewardship and conservation.</p> <p><b>Threatened by Climate Change</b><br> Even a small insect can tell the story of global climate change.  Academy curator Dave Kavanaugh and graduate student Sean Schoville discovered the ice beetle <i>Nebria praedicta</i> on a single peak in California's Trinity Alps.  The beetle lives only in the presence of glaciers and snowfields, which are melting under current warming trends.  In the paper, the authors write: "The disappearance of these temperature moderating bodies, which is virtually certain to occur with the current climatic warming trend, would be catastrophic for this species...and likely lead to their quick extinction."</p>  <p><b>Spiders from Yunnan, China</b><br> Arthropods (insects, arachnids, and their relatives) are the most diverse group of animals on Earth.  Accordingly, over two-thirds of the new species on the Academy's list are arthropods.  A paper by Academy research associate Jeremy Miller, curator Charles Griswold, and collaborator Chang Min Yin describes 36 new spider species, all from Yunnan Province, China.  This paper is the latest result from an ongoing, ten-year inventory of this biodiversity hotspot, led by Academy and Chinese scientists.  Griswold co-authored two additional papers in 2009 describing spiders from Yunnan (<i>Mallinela bifurcata</i>, <i>M. biumbonalia</i>, <i>M. kunmingensis</i>, and <i>Sanmenia tengchong</i>).</p> <p><b>California Hotspot</b><br> Besides hosting a diverse population of people, California is also home to one of the most diverse collections of plant and animal species on the planet. This rich diversity has earned California a title as one of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots.  Ten species on this year's list were collected in or just off the shore of California (though not necessarily endemic to the state): the aforementioned black ghostshark (<i>Hydrolagus melanophasma</i>), deep-sea coral (<i>Gersemia juliepackardae</i>), and ice beetle (<i>Nebria praedicta</i>); four mite species that live parasitically in the feathers of birds (<i>Syringophiloidus sialius</i>, <i>Torotrogla coccothraustes</i>, <i>T. cyanocitta</i>, and <i>T. piranga</i>); two mosses from Yosemite National Park (<i>Homalothecium californicum</i> and <i>Pseudoleskea tribulosa</i>); and a lacewing (<i>Ceraeochrysa chiricahuae</i>) found all over the United States.</p> <p><b>Fossil Raccoon Dog</b><br>Ten years ago, anthropology curator Zeray Alemseged initiated the Dikika Research Project to explore the fossil-rich Awash Valley in Ethiopia.  While the project has yielded several important discoveries related to early human evolution (including an infant <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> fossil, dubbed "the world’s oldest child" in 2006), the non-human discoveries provide equally important information about the valley's ancient environment.  This year, Alemseged and his colleagues report the only new mammal species on the Academy's list: a raccoon dog (<i>Nyctereutes lockwoodi</i>) from 3.3 million years ago.  Described from a nearly complete skull and fragments of others, this small, omnivorous mammal is a member of the canid family, which includes dogs, wolves, and foxes.  Fossil raccoon dogs have been uncovered throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa, but only one species remains today (<i>N. procyonoides</i>, native to East Asia). This extant species gets its common name from its raccoon-like coloring but is not closely related to raccoons - its closest living relatives are thought to be foxes. It forms monogamous pair bonds and is the only member of the dog family to hibernate in the winter.</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth's living things.

			<div id="pr_body"> <p>SAN FRANCISCO (February 25, 2009) — Are Americans flunking science?  A new national survey commissioned by the California Academy of Sciences and conducted by Harris Interactive® reveals that the U.S. public is unable to pass even a basic scientific literacy test.</p>  <p>Over the past few months, the American government has allocated hundreds of billions of dollars for economic bailout plans. While this spending may provide a short-term solution to the country's economic woes, most analysts agree that the long-term solution must include a transition to a more knowledge-based economy, including a focus on science, which is now widely recognized as a major driver of innovation and industry. Despite its importance to economic growth, environmental protection, and global health and energy issues, scientific literacy is currently low among American adults. According to the national survey commissioned by the California Academy of Sciences:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Only 53% of adults know how long it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun.</li> <li>Only 59% of adults know that the earliest humans and dinosaurs did not live at the same time.</li>  <li>Only 47% of adults can roughly approximate the percent of the Earth's surface that is covered with water.*</li>  <li>Only 21% of adults answered all three questions correctly.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knowledge about some key scientific issues is also low. Despite the fact that access to fresh water is likely to be one of the most pressing environmental issues over the coming years, less than 1% of U.S. adults know what percent of the planet's water is fresh (the correct answer is 3%). Nearly half didn't even hazard a guess. Additionally, 40% of U.S. adults say they are "not at all knowledgeable" about sustainability.</p> <p>Despite this lack of knowledge, U.S. adults do believe that scientific research and education are important. About 4 in 5 adults think science education is "absolutely essential" or "very important" to the U.S. healthcare system (86%), the U.S. global reputation (79%), and the U.S. economy (77%).</p> <p>"There has never been a greater need for investment in scientific research and education," said Academy Executive Director Dr. Gregory Farrington. "Many of the most pressing issues of our time—from global climate change to resource management and disease—can only be addressed with the help of science."</p>  <p>To test your own scientific knowledge, please visit the California Academy of Sciences' website at www.calacademy.org.</p> <p><b>Methodology</b><br>This survey was conducted by telephone within the United States by Harris Interactive on behalf of the California Academy of Science between December 17 and December 21, 2008 among 1,002 adults ages 18+. For complete methodology, including weighting variables, please contact Andrew Ng at 415.379.5123 or Kelly Taylor at 415.359.2313.</p>   <p><b>Education and Research at the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The California Academy of Sciences is one of the world's preeminent natural history museums and is an international leader in scientific research about the natural world. In addition to its public exhibits and aquarium displays, the Academy is home to over 100 scientists and educators, as well as over 20 million scientific specimens. These specimens span several centuries and all seven continents, and they are used to study everything from the historical presence of environmental toxins to the spread of parasites. They are also the foundation for determining the evolutionary tree of life and creating maps that are used to identify conservation priorities. Through research expeditions to some of the least-known places on the planet, Academy scientists continue to build these collections, strengthening our understanding of the world around us. Meanwhile, Academy educators are working with both museum visitors and school teachers to share this information in creative, engaging ways, inspiring a passion for science and the natural world.</p> <p><i>* The approximately correct answer range for this question was defined as anything between 65% and 75%.</i></p>

			<div id="pr_header"><b>SAN FRANCISCO ARTS COMMISSION'S PUBLIC ART PROGRAM<br> BACKGROUNDER</b>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">  The Arts Commission’s Public Art Program was established by the City Arts Enrichment Ordinance in 1969. One of the first of its kind in the country, the Arts Enrichment Ordinance provides for two percent of the construction cost of civic buildings, transportation improvement projects, new parks, and other above-ground structures such as bridges, to be allocated for public art. It also provides an allowance for artwork conservation funds and allows for the pooling of art enrichment funds for interdepartmental projects. The Program is administered by the mayoral-appointed San Francisco Arts Commission and is overseen by the Visual Arts Committee, a subgroup of the Commission.<br>&nbsp;<br> The Public Art Program provides curatorial expertise and project management for the implementation of the Arts Enrichment Ordinance. The Program’s goals include promoting a diverse and stimulating cultural environment to enrich the lives of the City’s residents, visitors and employees. Typically, public art is developed and implemented in conjunction with the overall design and construction of each project. The Program encourages the creative interaction of artists, designers, city staff, officials and community members during the design of City projects, in order to develop public art that is specific to the site and meaningful to the community. <br>&nbsp;<br> In addition to being its 40th anniversary, 2009 has been a landmark year for the Public Art Program. The year kicked off with the installation of Tony Labat’s <i>Big Peace IV</i>, a sculpture commemorating the 50th anniversary of the symbol’s creation, at Patricia’s Green, located on Hayes Street. In February, renowned environmental artist Patrick Dougherty created a new work, titled <i>The Upper Crust</i>, comprised of 4,500 pounds of freshly cut willow saplings interwoven into the tops of the sycamore trees located on the plaza across from San Francisco’s City Hall. <i>The Upper Crust</i> was joined by several other public art projects at the new Portola Branch Library, J.P. Murphy Clubhouse, Harvey Milk Center for Recreational Arts and the San Francisco Zoo. At the Americans for the Arts Convention in June, the recently completed <i>The Language of the Birds</i>, located in North Beach, by San Francisco-artists Brian Goggin and Dorka Keehn was honored as one of America’s best public art projects. <br> &nbsp;<br> Other current, comprehensive public art projects include the installation of over one hundred original artworks at the new Laguna Honda Hospital, which will open in the spring of 2010; San Francisco International Airport’s Terminal 2, completion slated for 2011; the Central Subway, scheduled completion in 2017 and the Transbay Terminal, projected completion in 2019.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 23, 2009) – Almost one year to the day since the new California Academy of Sciences opened in Golden Gate Park, a new space show called <i>Journey to the Stars</i> will open at Morrison Planetarium on September 26, 2009. Narrated by Whoopi Goldberg, the show will launch visitors through time and space to experience the dramatic lives and deaths of stars. Like the Morrison's inaugural show <i>Fragile Planet</i>, <i>Journey to the Stars</i> will be tailored to the all-digital planetarium's 75-foot-diameter screen and continue the tradition of facilitation by a live presenter.</p>   <p><i>Journey </i>begins as the Sun sets over the Golden Gate Bridge, then travels 13 billion years into the past, when the first stars were born. As they fly through space and time, audiences will experience the brilliant supernova explosions that sent new kinds of matter coursing through space, seeding the Universe with the elements necessary for life as we know it. Passengers will also dive into the heart of our fiery Sun, glimpsing its eventual demise as it transforms into a massive red giant some five billion years in the future. By the end of the show, which depicts sunrise over downtown San Francisco, visitors will have witnessed the formation of stars, explored celestial mysteries, and discovered the deep-rooted connection between humanity and the stars.</p> <p>The show will play 7-10 times a day, every day in Morrison Planetarium until the fall of 2010.  In addition, the Academy's Benjamin Dean Astronomy Lectures in early 2010 will give audiences a chance to meet the scientists who worked with <i>Journey</i>'s production team.  Speakers will include Dr. Ben Oppenheimer, astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History and curator for the show (January); Dr. Tom Abel, professor at Stanford University who contributed data and visualizations (February); and Dr. Alan Title, solar physicist at Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center (March).  Check www.calacademy.org/events for lecture details.</p> <p><i>Journey to the Stars</i> was developed by the American Museum of Natural History, New York (www.amnh.org) in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences as well as GOTO INC., Tokyo, Japan; Papalote Museo del Niño, Mexico City, Mexico; and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.  The show was created with the major support and partnership of NASA, Science Mission Directorate, Heliophysics Division.</p> <p><i>Note: The Morrison's inaugural show </i>Fragile Planet<i> will end on September 25, 2009, but it will continue to play at the Academy's weekly NightLife events (ages 21+).</i></p>

			<div id="pr_body">SAN FRANCISCO (July 27, 2009) — Summer nights in San Francisco just got steamier. Visitors to the California Academy of Sciences can now enjoy the four-story rainforest exhibit, the swampy alligator habitat, the mangrove lagoon, and the rest of the museum’s exhibits and shows until 8:00 pm every Monday and Tuesday from August 3 through September 8, 2009. San Francisco residents and tourists alike can take advantage of the long summer days to visit the Academy during off-peak times for Golden Gate Park—and to catch some of the aquarium’s nocturnal animals at their most active. <br>&nbsp; <br> “We have been delighted by the strong interest that San Francisco residents and visitors have shown in the new Academy since we opened last September,” said Dr. Greg Farrington, executive director of the Academy. “These extended summer hours will help ensure that everyone who wants to visit with our penguins and zoom through our digital Universe is able to do so.”<br>&nbsp; <br> Throughout the extended summer hours program, all of the Academy’s exhibits will remain open until 8:00 pm on Monday and Tuesday nights, and the planetarium and 3D theater will offer additional shows. The Academy Cafe will also remain open, giving working parents the opportunity to bring their kids to the Academy for “dinner and a museum” as a special weeknight treat. <br>&nbsp; <br> Regular admission fees will apply for the Academy’s extended summer hours; Academy members will be admitted free of charge. Unlike the Academy’s weekly Thursday night program, NightLife, during which adults ages 21 and over can enjoy the museum from 6:00 – 10:00 pm, the Academy’s extended summer hours on Monday and Tuesday nights will be available for all ages. Tickets can be purchased at the door or in advance online at www.calacademy.org/tickets. As always, visitors who take public transportation receive a $3 discount.<br>&nbsp; <br> On Monday, August 3, evening visitors can also choose to attend an astronomy lecture by Margaret Race from the SETI Institute. Hosted inside the Academy’s 90-foot diameter planetarium dome, the lecture will begin at 7:30 pm. During the talk, Race will describe how experts from many different disciplines contribute to searches for extraterrestrial life—and explain how the Outer Space Treaty and planetary protection policies urge “responsible exploration” when visiting other planets. Lecture tickets cost $10, and advanced purchase is recommended. Tickets can be purchased online or by calling 800-794-7576.

			<div id="pr_header"><b>CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES RECOGNIZED AS <br>ONE OF WORLD'S FINEST IN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT<br></b><p><i><b>The Urban Land Institute announces winners of the 2009 Global Awards for Excellence Competition</b></i></p>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (November 6, 2009) Five outstanding developments have been selected as winners of the 2009 Urban Land Institute's (ULI) Global Awards for Excellence competition, widely recognized as the land use industry’s most prestigious recognition program. The winners are: the American University in Cairo - New Campus, Cairo, Egypt; California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco; The Rise, Vancouver, British Columbia; West Chelsea/High Line Rezoning Plan, New York City; and Zhongshan Shipyard Park, Zhongshan, China.<br>   &nbsp;   <br>   The competition is part of the Institute’s Awards for Excellence program, established in 1979, which is based on ULI’s guiding principle that the achievement of excellence in land use practice should be recognized and rewarded. ULI’s Awards for Excellence recognize the full development process of a project, not just its architecture or design. The criteria for the awards include leadership, contribution to the community, innovations, public/private partnership, environmental protection and enhancement, response to societal needs, and financial success.<br>   &nbsp;   <br>   The winners were announced today during the ULI Fall Meeting in San Francisco. “While the 2009 winners are very different in development type, they all share a commitment to high quality that is reflected in exceptional design and craft, and in cultural relevance," said 2009 Global Awards for Excellence Jury Chairman Joseph E. Brown, Group Chief Executive of AECOM in San Francisco. "It was very rewarding to see the cultural strength, authenticity and originality shown by all the winners.” <br>   &nbsp;   <br>   According to ULI Chief Executive Officer Patrick L. Phillips, the award winners illustrate that well-designed, well-built projects can thrive even in the most challenging of economic times. “These global winners showcase the best in creativity, innovation, and long-term thinking,” Phillips said. “The ULI Awards for Excellence program is a timely reminder of the key difference responsible land use can make in terms of community longevity and sustainability.”<br>   &nbsp; <br>The 2009 winners were selected from 21 worldwide finalists, all of whom were winners in their region: The Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. The global awards jury evaluated these projects with additional criteria, including: innovative concepts that can be emulated around the world; strong urban design; response to the surrounding environment; and design that contributes to a livable, sustainable development that demonstrates relevance to the needs of the community.<br>&nbsp;<br>   The 2009 Global Awards for Excellence winners (developers in parentheses):<br><br>   - <b>American University in Cairo - New Campus, Cairo, Egypt </b>(AUC) The university’s new campus is located at the center of New Cairo City, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the current campus in downtown Cairo. It is designed to be a tool and stimulus in itself for learning and to anchor community development around the university. The 105-hectare (260-acre) virgin desert site has been developed into 200,000 square meters (2.2 million sq ft) of energy-efficient housing and academic, administrative, and student life facilities. <br><br>   - <b>California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, California</b> (The California Academy of Sciences) One of the world’s largest LEED-Platinum public buildings, the $488 million California Academy of Sciences houses an aquarium, planetarium, natural history museum, and four-story rain forest. The 412,000 square-foot project, located in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, was designed with the goal of preserving the natural habitats, species, and resources of the local environment. <br><br>   - <b>The Rise, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada </b>(Grosvenor Americas) The Rise, a mid-rise building adjacent to a rapid transit station, successfully mixes large-format retail uses, locally-focused stores, and 92 rooftop live/work units that surround a 20,000 square foot green roof. The building uses one-third less energy and two-thirds less potable water than required by Canadian energy code, while the design establishes a new model of mixed-use development in Vancouver. <br><br>   - <b>West Chelsea/High Line Rezoning Plan, New York, New York</b> (City of New York, Department of Planning) Using an innovative transfer of development rights (TDR) scheme, this plan has spurred the development of over 1,000 residential units and 2 million square feet of commercial space in West Chelsea. The defining feature of the special district is High Line Park---formerly an abandoned elevated rail line---which will become a 22-block-long linear park running through the district. <br><br>   - <b>Zhongshan Shipyard Park, Zhongshan, China</b> (Zhongshan City, Planning Bureau) Built on a dilapidated shipyard, the Zhongshan Shipyard Park is eleven hectares (27 ac) of reclaimed wetlands, restored shoreline, and landscaped park space that references its industrial past with salvaged docks and machinery. The design gives much attention to restoring leftover structures, connecting with the existing urban context, and environmental responsibility. <br><br> The 2009 Global Awards for Excellence winners were selected by a jury of renowned land use development and design experts. In addition to Jury Chairman Joseph E. Brown, other members were Richard Gollis, principal, The Concord Group LLC, Newport Beach; Ian Hawksworth, managing director, Capital &amp; Counties, London; Raj Menda, managing director, RMZ Corp, Bangalore; and Marilee Utter, president, Citiventure Associates LLC, Denver. </p> <p>Over the years, the Awards for Excellence program has evolved from recognition of one development in North America to an international competition with multiple winners. The ULI Awards for Excellence: Europe was added in 2004 and in 2005, the ULI Awards for Excellence: Asia Pacific was added. Throughout the program’s history all types of projects have been recognized for their excellence, including office, residential, recreational, urban/mixed-use, industrial/office park, commercial/retail, new community, rehabilitation, and public projects and programs.&nbsp; More information about ULI’s Awards for Excellence program is at <a href="http://www.uli.org/awardsandcompetitions">http://www.uli.org/awardsandcompetitions</a>.<b><br><br>About the Urban Land Institute</b><br>   The Urban Land Institute (www.uli.org) is a global nonprofit education and research institute supported by its members. Its mission is to provide leadership in the responsible use of land and in creating and sustaining thriving communities worldwide. Established in 1936, the Institute has nearly 34,000 members representing all aspects of land use and development disciplines.   <br>   &nbsp;<br><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The California Academy of Sciences is a world-class scientific and cultural institution based in San Francisco, home to Steinhart Aquarium, Morrison Planetarium, and Kimball Natural History Museum, along with research and education programs. In 2008, the Academy opened a new LEED Platinum-rated facility, and remains the only institution in the world to combine all of those elements under one roof.

Never has the status of science and scientists been held in higher esteem and never has the public taken a greater personal interest in natural history than in the mid-19th century when Charles Darwin was developing his revolutionary insights. During this heyday, no middle-class home was without its display of sea shells, butterflies, or stuffed birds—the home aquarium became fashionable, nature guides were bestsellers, and the first dinosaur theme park was built. Most of today’s great public science museums, including the California Academy of Sciences, were founded amid this enchantment with natural history. John Dillon will examine the irony of how Darwin’s work was nurtured by this heyday, yet hastened its demise. <i>12:15pm; free with General Admission, but an RSVP is required as seating is limited and fills up quickly.

Matthew James will examine the historical background of the expedition, the lives of the scientists on board, why Darwin went to the Galapagos in 1835 on board the HMS Beagle, and the lasting significance of the 1905-06 expedition today with regard to species conservation and DNA studies. <br><i>12:15pm; free with General Admission, but an RSVP is required as seating is limited and fills up quickly.

Beagle journeying around the world. His book, <i>The Voyage of the Beagle</i>, is a travel memoir, an adventure story, and a scientific primer. In it Darwin observed nature and began to shape his thinking on evolution. Join us for discussion of the book focusing on Chapters, 1-4, 8-9 and 17. <i>6:30pm; admission is free, but an RSVP is required as seating is limited; to RSVP, call 415-379-5494.

A mysterious sea creature is terrorizing the seas, causing damage to several ships. The United States government organizes an expedition led by a leading French marine biologist, Professor Pierre Aronnax, to find the creature and destroy it. The creature, which turns out to be a submarine manned by the eccentric Capitan Nemo, attacks the expedition’s ship and takes its survivors captive. They end up going on a year-long journey exploring the wonders of the seas. Join us for a lively discussion of this science-fiction classic that was first published in 1870. <i>Free with General Admission, but an RSVP is required as seating is limited; to RSVP, call 415-379-5494.

What can one individual do to save a threatened population? When zookeeper Sharon Matola learned that a dam would be built that would flood the nesting ground of the only scarlet macaws in Belize, she took up the cause. Barcott's account of her battle ranges from boardroom to courtroom and from the local village to protests around the world. Join other adults for a discussion of one woman's quest and the lessons it may offer for environmentalists everywhere. <i>6:30pm; admission is free, but an RSVP is required as seating is limited; to RSVP, call 415-379-5494.

			<div id="pr_body"> <p>SAN FRANCISO (May 13, 2009) – Although they cover more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface and are critically important to the health of our global ecosystem, the oceans are some of the least explored and most threatened places on our planet. In light of this, the United Nations issued an official resolution this spring designating June 8, 2009 as the first annual World Oceans Day. The Academy's scientists - and its thousands of aquatic residents - will help visitors celebrate this international event with a suite of special programs from June 4-16, 2009.</p> <p>The festivities, which include sustainable seafood cooking demonstrations, a beach clean-up, costumed stilt-walkers, animal feeding shows, lectures, and the launch of a new online forum for sharing ideas about ocean protection, are designed to help visitors explore the amazing biodiversity of our oceans and find ways to help protect this valuable resource. Please see specific program listings and details below.</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p><b>THURSDAY, JUNE 4<br>NightLife, featuring Plastiki and David de Rothschild<br>6:00 - 10:00 pm</b><br>Every Thursday night, the Academy opens its doors from 6-10 pm for NightLife, a chance for adults to explore the museum in a whole new light. This week, environmentalist David de Rothschild will give two lectures (at 7:30 and 8:30 pm) about his upcoming voyage across the Pacific in a 60-foot vessel constructed entirely of recycled materials, mostly plastic water bottles. The point of this endeavor? To not only continue encouraging the world to focus on reducing, reusing and recycling more of its natural resources, but ultimately to think smart by re-thinking waste as a resource. During the voyage, de Rothschild will navigate through a man-made disaster called the Eastern Pacific Garbage Patch, a floating landfill located between California and Hawaii that’s twice the size of Texas. The Academy will debut a new "Science in Action" film about the upcoming voyage during the event. As always, visitors can also dance to one of San Francisco's most popular DJs, enjoy food and cocktails, and mingle with the like-minded while exploring the Academy’s world-class exhibits and meeting aquarium critters. NightLife is for those ages 21 and over; a valid ID is required for entry.  <i>Admission is $10 for non-member adults, $8 for members. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park.  (415) 379-8000. www.calacademy.org/nightlife.</i></p>&nbsp;<br><p><b>SATURDAY, JUNE 6<br>World Oceans Day Festival<br>9:30 am - 5:00 pm</b> <br>Explore the beauty of the oceans by coming face-to-face with thousands of aquatic animals in the Academy's aquarium displays. While you wander, keep an eye out for giant jellyfish and octopi - costumed stilt-walkers will be roaming the Academy's halls. And be sure to visit the 50-foot-long "Salmon Tent" in the Academy's west garden, where kids can listen to salmon-themed stories and learn about the plight of these beautiful fish.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">SAN FRANCISCO (September 29, 2010) — California Academy of Sciences Executive Director Greg Farrington, Ph.D., has announced that Elizabeth Babcock, Ph.D. will join the Academy as the Roberts Dean of Education in October 2010. Babcock is currently the Vice President of Education and Library Collections for the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The first person to fill the Academy’s newly-endowed Dean of Education role, Babcock will be responsible for creating, funding, and implementing the museum’s formal education programs.<br>   &nbsp;<br> “When we created the new Dean of Education role, our goal was to hire a first-rate, creative, imaginative, passionate, impatient, energetic and highly entrepreneurial candidate—and Dr. Babcock embodies all of those qualities,” said Farrington. “At a time when global climate change is affecting everything from crops to coral reefs, species that support human health are disappearing, and diseases are developing immunities to our medicines, it is hard to argue that science isn’t an integral part of our daily lives. Yet scientific literacy levels remain shockingly low. The need for innovative, visionary programs of science education has never been greater, and we look forward to accelerating our efforts to address this need with Dr. Babcock on our team.”<br>&nbsp;<br>   Babcock will lead a dedicated team of educators at the Academy who deliver a wide variety of formal education programs, including the Teacher Institute on Science and Sustainability, the Careers in Science intern program, the BioForum continuing education series, and a number of other teacher and student services. She will also lead the development of new initiatives, including programs that allow the Academy to reach teachers and students beyond the Bay Area.<br>&nbsp;<br> “I am thrilled to be joining an organization that has demonstrated such a forward-thinking approach to addressing some of the most pressing problems of our time,” says Babcock. “I believe that museums like the Academy have the potential to play an enormous role in solving the educational crisis we are facing, and I look forward to expanding the impact that the Academy can make in this arena, both within and beyond the Bay Area.”<br>&nbsp;<br>   Babcock has been at the Field Museum since 2002, where she has demonstrated her innovative approach to museum-based education by launching several digital learning initiatives, including “WhyReef” and “Animal Adventures”, virtual world projects for teens and tweens that leverage museum collections and new technologies to engage these audiences in the topics of ecology and conservation. In her current role as the Vice President of Education and Library Collections, Babcock is responsible for the development and implementation of education programs, outreach initiatives, and digital programming to over 800,000 adults, families, teachers and students each year.<br>&nbsp;<br>   Before joining the Field Museum, Babcock worked as a consultant and program developer, designing community outreach strategies and environmental education programs. She also worked for several years in the corporate sector, managing user experience research and design projects in the financial, consumer products, and technology industries. <br>&nbsp;<br>   Babcock has taught K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and adult students in a range of content areas, including music for special needs students, environmental anthropology, sustainable development, introductory anthropology, and adult literacy. She holds a Ph.D. and M.A. in Cultural Anthropology from Indiana University, where she studied international migration and Belizean voluntary associations. She also holds a B.A. in Psychology and a B.M. in Music Education from Northwestern University. <br>&nbsp;<br>   The new Roberts Dean of Education chair was endowed by the Roberts Foundation, with additional funding provided by the Pisces Foundation.<br>&nbsp;<br> Babcock will join the California Academy of Sciences on October 12, 2010.

This tantalizing question forms the basis of Morrison Planetarium's newest show, narrated by two-time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster. Begin your journey by “shrinking” down to enter a single redwood leaf, and discover that all life on Earth shares a common ancestry. Then, travel through time to witness key events since the Big Bang that set the stage for life. Along the way, you will see two scenarios for the dawn of life on early Earth, and discover how our planet has changed since those microscopic beginnings. </li></ul><p><b>African Hall – ongoing exhibit</b><br>   Take a virtual safari through Africa by exploring the majestic dioramas of African Hall. Lions and cheetahs face off with zebras and antelope through the glass windows of their detailed displays, and a lowland gorilla invites you to ponder your ancestry. Look closely as you wander through the hall—these dioramas contain a few surprises: live tortoises, lizards, and fish have taken up residence in some of the smaller displays, and African penguins dip and dive in a 25,000-gallon tank at the end of the hall. Penguin feedings take place daily at 10:30 am and 3:30 pm. <i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (January 13, 2011) – A research team from across the United States and Ecuador has pinpointed 1898 as the year the avipoxvirus, or avian pox, hit the Galapagos Islands and started infecting its birds. This estimation is vital to understanding avian diseases that affect today's Galapagos birds. The scientists' paper on the subject, "<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015989" target="_blank">110 Years of <i>Avipoxvirus </i>in the Galapagos Islands</a>," was published on January 13 in <i>PLoS ONE</i>, an international, open-access science publication.</p>  <p>The research team, led by Dr. Patricia Parker of the University of Missouri–St. Louis, examined 3,607 finches and mockingbirds collected in the Galapagos between 1898 and 1906 that are currently held at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, along with 266 birds collected in 1891 and 1897 held at the Zoologische Staatssammlung in Munich, Germany. The scientists inspected the birds for skin lesions associated with avian pox infection and found 226 candidates dating from 1898 or later. For a small subset of these (59 specimens), the scientists took tissue samples for further pathological studies. In the end, a total of 21 specimens scored positive for avipoxvirus using histology (tissue examination under a microscope) and genotyping (screening for viral DNA).</p>  <p>"Without museum collections, work like this would never be possible," said Dr. Jack Dumbacher, Curator of Ornithology at the California Academy of Sciences. "Because museum specimens include detailed collection date and location data, they can be used to study not only a particular species, but also historical events and environmental conditions. Without this library of specimens, we might never have learned when or how this potentially devastating disease made its way to Darwin's famous islands."</p>  <p>The Academy has a deeply rooted history of research in the Galapagos, where it helped to found the Charles Darwin Research Station at Academy Bay, as well as the Galapagos National Park. The museum sent its first expedition to these storied islands in 1905. For about a year, the Academy's team of scientists inventoried everything from plants, fossils, and birds that are now extinct to the iconic marine iguanas that still bask on coastal rocks. By the time the team returned to San Francisco, the 1906 earthquake and fire had destroyed most of the Academy's research collections, so the 70,000 scientific specimens collected during the expedition formed the basis for rebuilding the institution. Since then, the Academy has organized dozens of return trips and is now home to the world's largest collection of scientific specimens from the Galapagos. Most of the museum's current field work in the Galapagos focuses on the marine environment, where dozens of new species have been discovered in the last decade.</p>  <p>The <i>PLoS ONE</i> study is the latest example of how this invaluable collection continues to provide insight into evolutionary and ecological processes on the islands. According to the paper, the role of disease in regulating populations is controversial, partly owing to the absence of good disease records in historic wildlife populations. The authors hope to fill that void with the new approaches taken in their paper.</p>  <p>"The combination of an extensive museum collection and modern genetics and histology have allowed us to home in on the arrival date of an important virus that threatens today's populations of unique birds," said Parker, Professor of Zoological Studies at the University of Missouri–St. Louis and lead author on the paper. "We are all excited to not only have the arrival date estimate, but to have important insights into the role that humans have played (and still play) in spreading pathogens like this virus."</p>  <p>Parker and her colleagues note that while there have been no known extinctions of bird species on the Galapagos Islands as a whole, the extinction rate on individual islands is approximately 100 times higher since human colonization than before human arrival. The history of avipoxvirus on the Galapagos is an important data point for understanding this accelerated population-level extinction. The museum specimens demonstrate that shortly after its arrival, the virus was much more likely to be found on human-inhabited islands, suggesting that humans inadvertently helped it to spread.</p>  <p>"Now that we know that humans likely played a role in facilitating the spread of avian pox in the Galapagos, we'll be better equipped to develop policies designed to prevent further spread of the disease," says Dumbacher.</p>  <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> Founded in 1853, the Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (November 8, 2010) —The California Academy of Sciences will launch its first-ever iPhone app, the <b>Golden Gate Park Field Guide</b>, on November 9, 2010, leveraging technology to help users explore the flora, fauna, and hidden gems of the 1,017-acre urban oasis. The park is home to an unparalleled blend of outdoor splendor, history, and culture, though its sheer size and labyrinthine roads and pathways make some of those treasures difficult to find. For the first time, the GGP Guide will bring together practical information and insights about the park’s attractions, which include renowned architectural landmarks, an array of plant and animal species, dozens of statues, gardens and lakes, museums, and numerous sports facilities. </p><p>&nbsp;<br> Organized into four key sections, the app encourages observation from a naturalist’s point of view, and allows visitors to tailor their experience in Golden Gate Park based on personal interests, mode of transportation, and other factors. Its key features include:</p> <ul><li><b>Field Guide</b>: A dynamic guide highlighting more than 170 of the park’s animal and plant species, including a few surprises like wild coyotes and blackberry bushes. </li>   <li> <b>Park Map</b>: An interactive map and live weather data offer valuable practical information, helping users plan ahead, locate off-the-beaten-path landmarks, and even find which of the park’s 60 attractions, 4 restaurants, or 15 public restrooms  are closest to their location.</li>   <li><b>Adventures</b>: Tour routes provide ideas to enrich any visit, whether travelling by foot, bicycle or car. Scavenger hunts help users discover native species, examples of camouflage in action, and more. </li>   <li> <b>Sightings</b>: “Citizen scientists” can add their own sightings and photos to the growing database, and help record the park’s biodiversity. Recent wildlife sightings are even reported in real-time via the app’s map feature.</li> </ul><p>The GGP Guide is currently available for free in the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/golden-gate-park-field-guide/id401315705?mt=8">iTunes Store</a>, and via <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/apps/ggp" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/apps/ggp</a>. The app was designed by Odopod and developed by SourceN for the California Academy of Sciences.<br>&nbsp;<br> As a complement to this new iPhone application, the Academy has developed tailored itineraries for tourists that offer specific suggestions for couples, groups of friends, and families exploring Golden Gate Park.

			<div id="pr_body"><p><b>Overview</b><br> Home to an aquarium, planetarium, natural history museum, and world-class research and education programs, the California Academy of Sciences is one of San Francisco's must-see destinations. From the splashing penguins in African Hall to the wildflowers on the roof, the building is bursting with life. A four-story living rainforest and awe-inspiring coral reef ecosystem will delight visitors of all ages, while immersive space shows will transport audiences beyond the boundaries of our planet. Opportunities abound to meet Academy scientists, share in their discoveries, and join the journey to make our world a greener, more sustainable place to live.</p> <p><b><br>100 Word Description </b><br>   Come nose-to-beak with penguins and parrots, watch sharks and sting rays cruise beneath your feet, and feel the spray of the California coast. Fly through space and time from the safety of your planetarium seat, take a virtual safari in African Hall, or climb into the canopy of a living rainforest. Face your fears—and an albino alligator—inside the Swamp, and meet scientists as they return from research expeditions around the world. From the depths of a Philippine coral reef to the outer reaches of the Universe, it's all inside the California Academy of Sciences.</p> <p><b><br>Address </b><br>   55 Music Concourse Drive <br>   Golden Gate Park<br> San Francisco, CA 94118 </p> <p><b><br>Phone</b>: (415) 379-8000<br><b>Email</b>: <a href="mailto:info@calacademy.org">info@calacademy.org </a><br><b>Website</b>: <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/">www.calacademy.org</a> </p> <p><b><br>Hours of Operation</b> <br>   Monday – Saturday: 9:30 am - 5:00 pm <br>   Sunday: 11:00 am - 5:00 pm<br>   Closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas<br>   *On Thursday nights, the Academy is also open from 6-10pm for NightLife, a weekly event for visitors ages 21 and up, featuring music, bars, and cutting-edge science. </p> <p><b><br>Admission</b><br>   Adults: $29.95<br>   Youth (ages 12-17): $24.95<br>   Senior (ages 65 and over): $24.95<br>   Child (ages 4-11): $19.95<br>   Ages 3 and under: FREE<br>   Discount for taking public transportation to the Academy: $3 per person&nbsp;<br><i>Note: Prices include access to all components of the Academy experience, including all museum exhibits, aquarium displays, planetarium shows, and the living rainforest.

Delve into the science of sex as you encounter live animals that have evolved remarkable and often surprising techniques for attracting mates and producing offspring. Meet snails that shoot "love darts" at one another, octopuses that are literally willing to lose an arm for the chance to mate, barnacles that win the award for most well-endowed, and more than a dozen other notable creatures. Museum specimens from around the world provide windows into additional mating and courtship practices, and interactive iPad labels offer slideshows and video footage of some of the most fascinating reproductive behaviors. You'll never think of the birds and the bees the same way again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p><p>   </p><p><b>Earthquake: Life on a Dynamic Planet </b><b><br>Prepare to be moved!&nbsp; In this major exhibit, delve into the science behind earthquakes and learn how societies prepare for and respond to these destructive phenomena.&nbsp; Experience a high-magnitude jolt in our earthquake simulator, walk through a 25-foot-diameter model of the Earth, and discover what to do before, during, and after an earthquake. Along the way, you’ll see how earthquakes fit into the larger story of plate tectonics, a constant process that builds mountains, moves continents, and creates the landscape in which life evolves or goes extinct.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p><p><b>African Hall - ongoing exhibit&nbsp;</b><br>   Take a virtual safari through Africa by exploring the majestic dioramas of African Hall. Lions and cheetahs face off with zebras and antelope through the glass windows of their detailed displays, and a lowland gorilla invites you to ponder your ancestry. Look closely as you wander through the hall—these dioramas contain a few surprises: live tortoises, lizards, and fish have taken up residence in some of the smaller displays, and African penguins dip and dive in a 25,000-gallon tank at the end of the hall. Penguin feedings take place twice a day.&nbsp;<i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm. California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park.

Watch waves roll onto a sandy beach, peek inside a 100,000-gallon rocky coast tank, play hide-and-seek with a giant Pacific octopus, and come face-to-face with leopard sharks. You can even hold a hermit crab at the Discovery Tidepool and meet a 165-pound sea bass in the Tank of Giants.&nbsp;<i>Open Monday-Saturday 9:30am-5:00pm; Sunday 11:00am-5:00pm.

Pieces range from the dramatic black-on-black pottery of Maria and Julian Martinez to the wrought silver bracelets of Kenneth Begay and others. Pieces from the 1920s through modern day document that certain designs and patterns persist. As they are carried on by successive generations, they are also simultaneously modified as the tradition evolves.

Part of the museum's green building strategy, the roof provides superior insulation, prevents storm water runoff, reduces the urban heat island effect, and creates new habitat for native birds, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. An engineering marvel, the seven hills of the living roof roll over the Academy’s major exhibits and echo the hilly topography of San Francisco.</p><p><b>Morrison Planetarium</b> <br><i>Upon arrival, please check the day’s show schedule, which is subject to change.

You will then embark on a high-speed tour through the past 200 million years, witnessing the formation of the Atlantic Ocean and visiting the cradle of humanity in Africa’s Great Rift Valley, along with sites of historic earthquakes in India, China, and Japan. Along the way, you will discover how seismic events continue to shape our landscape.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Philippine Coral Reef </b><b>- ongoing exhibit&nbsp;</b><br>Dive into the world's deepest living coral reef tank without donning a wetsuit. Five underwater windows offer a fish's eye view into one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. Find Nemo—and 2,000 other reef fish—darting through a technicolor forest of coral, watch garden eels emerge from their underwater burrows, and admire the brilliant hues of a giant clam. Talk to scuba divers inside the exhibit, and on the surface, follow a boardwalk through a mangrove lagoon, where sharks and sting rays cruise beneath your feet. </p><p><b>Rainforests of the World&nbsp;</b><b>- ongoing exhibit&nbsp;</b><br>Step inside a living rainforest, where water dripping from the mahogany and palm trees sets the beat for a symphony of croaking frogs and chirping birds. Peer into one of Borneo's caves, meet chameleons from Madagascar, and climb into the tree-tops of Costa Rica, where hundreds of tropical butterflies flutter like colorful confetti. Finally, descend in a glass elevator into the Amazonian flooded forest—the land of anacondas, piranhas, and electric eels. An acrylic tunnel allows you to walk beneath the Amazonian river fish that swim overhead.</p><p><b>Science in Action&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b>- ongoing exhibit</b><br>   Go beyond the headlines and gain in-depth information about recent scientific discoveries around the world. Live talks by Academy scientists and short video pieces provide timely and relevant news about the natural world.</p><p><b>The Swamp&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b>- ongoing exhibit</b><br>   Peer over the bronze railing of The Swamp tank if you dare—an American alligator and alligator snapping turtles rule the water below. Claude, a rare albino gator with startling white skin, may steal the lion's share of the attention, but it's hard to ignore his neighbors for too long. Snakes, frogs, and salamanders live in smaller tanks nearby, completing this snapshot of life in the swamps of the southeastern United States.</p><p><b>Water Planet&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b>- ongoing exhibit</b><br>   What does it take to live underwater?

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (January 13, 2011) – Dr. Rebecca Johnson, a postdoctoral researcher and sea slug expert at the California Academy of Sciences, has been named one of 16 Rubenstein Fellows by the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL).  These early-career scientists will use EOL as a platform for sharing their biodiversity research with colleagues and the general public.</p> <p>The Encyclopedia of Life (<a href="http://www.eol.org/">www.eol.org</a>) is an international collaboration that aims to provide freely accessible information about all of the 1.9 million known species on our planet.  EOL Rubenstein Fellows awards are made possible through a generous donation by David M. Rubenstein to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History. The program provides partial stipend or salary support for early-career scientists who wish to use EOL as a platform for outreach and encouraging other young scientists to do the same.  More than 60 fellowships are expected to be awarded over the four years of the program, which began in 2010.</p>  <p>Johnson began her career at the California Academy of Sciences 15 years ago, first as a post-college intern, then as a master’s and Ph.D. student under the guidance of Dr. Terry Gosliner, curator of invertebrate zoology at the Academy.  Her specialty is chromodorid nudibranchs (also known as sea slugs), a family of about 300 species that display beautiful, vivid colors and live in tropical shallow waters worldwide.  These Technicolor invertebrates aren’t just notable for their brazen beauty—they are also a potential source of medical treatments for a variety of human ailments, from heart disease to cancer. In addition to working as postdoctoral researcher at the Academy, Johnson also works with the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary to train tide pool naturalists at Duxbury Reef—a marine protected area in Marin County—and contributes to the Academy’s exhibits and education programs, including a recent display on the Farallon Islands.</p>  <p>“I am honored and excited to be a Rubenstein Fellow,” says Johnson. “With this award, I will use the Encyclopedia of Life as a platform with which to consolidate and organize historical data, new research findings, and information on chromodorid nudibranchs that is only found in the scientific literature, libraries, natural history museums, and scattered across the web.  As a fellow, I look forward to sharing the beauty of these animals with a larger audience and to making scientific information about them more widely available.”</p> <p>It’s easy to see why nudibranchs have captured Johnson’s attention for so many years.  Despite the common name of “sea slug,” nudibranchs are breathtaking in their beauty and variety.  Ranging from less than an inch to up to two feet long, nudibranchs occupy a wide range of aquatic habitats, from polar waters to tropical seas, shallow reefs to deep-sea trenches.  Over 3,000 species have been discovered and described to date, and scientists estimate that another 3,000 species are yet to be named.</p> <p>The name nudibranch means “naked gill”—unlike their close relatives, the snails, they have no shell covering their body and gills.  In some species, these gills take the form of feathery projections on the back; other species have them along the sides of their body; and some don’t have gills at all, but instead use their highly branched digestive system for respiration.</p> <p>Perhaps the most amazing trait of nudibranchs is their ability to exploit food in unique ways.  For example, some nudibranchs graze on corals and anemones—relatives of the jellyfish—without triggering the stinging cells of their prey.  They are then able to sequester these stinging cells into projections on their back.  As a result, any predator that comes too close will be stung by these co-opted cells.  Other nudibranchs feed on toxic sponges and sequester the toxins in their body without being poisoned themselves.</p> <p>Johnson’s research is helping to further our understanding of these fascinating animals, many of which may hold the key to future medical breakthroughs. Scientists have studied sea slugs' simple nervous systems for clues to learning and memory, and have raided their suite of defensive toxins in search of pharmaceuticals. They are also isolating chemicals that may help treat a variety of heart, bone, and brain conditions. A nudibranch relative known as a sea hare offered up a cancer-fighting compound that made it into clinical trials.</p> <p><b>About the EOL Rubenstein Fellowships</b><br> EOL Rubenstein Fellows are selected on the basis of stellar achievement, promise for continued accomplishment, and the diversity and relevance of their research. This year’s recipients specialize in a variety of taxonomic areas, ranging from rhododendrons of the world to African birds to flower flies.

This tantalizing question forms the basis of Morrison Planetarium's upcoming show, <i>Life: A Cosmic Story</i>, which will premiere on November 6, 2010. Located inside the California Academy of Sciences, the Morrison has transported audiences to the far reaches of the Universe and back since its opening in 2008.  Like the inaugural show <i>Fragile Planet</i>, <i>Life </i>takes audiences on an immersive, all-digital journey, featuring visualizations based on the latest scientific data.</p>        <p>"The show's core concept is that all life on Earth is related, having evolved from a common ancestor," says Ryan Wyatt, Director of Morrison Planetarium and Science Visualization. "Taking an even longer view, we see that life's origins begin with dark matter and the first stars—our pedigree is actually 13.7 billion years in the making."</p> <p>Narrated by two-time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster, <i>Life </i>begins in a grove of towering redwoods, majestic emblems of Northern California.  From there, the audience "shrinks" dramatically as it enters a single redwood leaf and then a redwood cell, learning that despite their unique appearance, redwoods are composed of the same basic molecules as all other organisms on Earth.  After this opening statement of shared ancestry, the audience launches on a journey through time, witnessing key events since the Big Bang that set the stage for life.  The first stars ignite, galaxies coalesce, and entire worlds take shape.  On the early Earth, two scenarios for the dawn of life are presented—one near a turbulent, deep-sea hydrothermal vent, and the other in a primordial "hot puddle" on a volcanic island.  From these microscopic beginnings, life transformed the entire Earth as it evolved and diversified: filling the atmosphere with oxygen, turning the continents green, and altering global climate patterns.  The 25-minute show ends with a review of geological evidence and the connectedness of all living things on Earth.</p> <p>To ensure that the show is as scientifically accurate and up-to-date as possible, the Academy drew on the expertise of several advisers who are leaders in their fields:</p>   <p>Dr. Jill Tarter, Director of the Center for SETI Research at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, consulted on the show with her extensive knowledge of astrobiology and the search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Tarter provided the real-life inspiration for Jodie Foster's character in the 1997 film <i>Contact</i>, and she is also a Fellow and Trustee of the California Academy of Sciences.</p> <p>Three scientists from the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) in Mountain View provided expertise as well: Dr. Carl Pilcher, Director of NAI; Dr. David Des Marais, Principal Investigator of NAI's Ames Research Center team; and Dr. Tori Hoehler, Research Scientist with the NAI Ames team.  Their collective research efforts focus on the origins, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the Universe.  Des Marais, who is heavily involved in the current Mars missions, gave insight into the possibility of life on Earth's next-door neighbor. Pilcher, Des Marais, and Hoehler are all Fellows of the Academy.</p> <p>Dr. David Deamer of the University of California, Santa Cruz, consulted on the chemical origins of life, especially for the "hot puddle" scenario depicted in the show.</p>   <p>The Academy also drew on its own scientists to ensure that even the tiniest details were accurate: botanically sound depictions of the redwood leaf and leaf interior; a realistic computer-generated ant along with its zig-zag walking pattern; and an appropriate selection of birdsongs for the redwood grove, taken from recordings made by former Academy curator Luis Baptista.</p>   <p>To produce the show's complex imagery, the Academy's Visualization Studio collaborated with Stanford University and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.  In May 2010, the Academy's Visualization Studio was one of four recipients of the international FullDome Award of Excellence for its inaugural production <i>Fragile Planet</i>.  The collective experience of its staff in the visual effects industry totals more than 120 years, including work at Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Pixar, and Lucasfilm Animation.</p> <p><i>Life: A Cosmic Story</i> will play 7-10 times every day in Morrison Planetarium through late 2011.  The Benjamin Dean Astronomy Lectures in December 2010, January 2011, and February 2011 at the Academy will provide in-depth discussions of topics covered in the show.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 26, 2010) – Paul the Octopus—the eight-legged oracle who made international headlines with his amazingly accurate football forecasting—isn't the only talented cephalopod in the sea. The Indonesian mimic octopus, which can impersonate flatfish and sea snakes to dupe potential predators, may well give Paul a run for his money when it comes to "see-worthy" skills.  By creatively configuring its limbs, adopting characteristic undulating movements, and displaying conspicuous color patterns, the mimic octopus (<i>Thaumoctopus mimicus</i>) can successfully pass for a number of different creatures that share its habitat, several of which are toxic. Now, scientists from the California Academy of Sciences and Conservation International Indonesia have conducted DNA analysis to determine how this remarkable adaptation evolved. The research is reported in the September 2010 issue of the <i>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</i>.</p>   <p>Like its relatives, the mimic octopus is very capable of hiding from hungry predators by blending into its background. However, this talented species often chooses to make itself <i>more</i> conspicuous to predators by mimicking flatfish, lionfish or sea snakes that display high-contrast color patterns. This daredevil maneuver is thought to help <i>T. mimicus</i> confuse or scare away predators. Because it is relatively rare for an animal to develop such a high-risk, conspicuous defense strategy, the authors of the recent study hoped to gain insight into the evolutionary forces that fueled this behavior by conducting genetic research on the mimic octopus and its relatives. They focused on the mimic's ability to flatten its arms and head and swim along the sea floor like a flatfish, while simultaneously exhibiting a bold, brown-and-white color pattern.</p> <p>Using DNA sequences to construct a genealogy for the mimic octopus and more than 35 of its relatives, the researchers ascertained the order in which the <i>T. mimicus</i> lineage evolved several key traits: 1) First, <i>T. mimicus</i> ancestors evolved the use of bold, brown-and-white color displays, employed as a secondary "shock" defense to surprise predators if camouflage fails.  2) Next, they developed the flatfish swimming technique and the long arms that facilitate this motion.  3) Finally, <i>T. mimcus</i> began displaying bold color patterns while impersonating a flatfish—both during daily forays away from its den and at rest.  In evolutionary terms, this last step represents an extremely risky shift in defense strategy.</p> <p>"The close relatives of <i>T. mimicus</i> use drab colors and camouflage quite successfully to hide from predators," says Dr. Christine Huffard, Marine Conservation Priorities Advisor at Conservation International Indonesia. "Why does <i>T. mimicus</i> instead draw attention to itself, and repeatedly abandon the camouflage abilities it inherited from its ancestors in favor of a bold new pattern?  Somehow, through natural selection, being conspicuous has allowed <i>T. mimicus</i> to survive and reproduce more successfully than some of its less showy ancestors, and eventually evolve into its own lineage."</p>   <p>The researchers suggest several possibilities for why this bold coloration would be advantageous.  It may fool predators into thinking the octopus is a toxic flatfish (such as the peacock sole, <i>Pardachirus pavoninus</i>, or the zebra sole, <i>Zebrias</i> spp.); it may obscure the octopus's outline against the black-and-white sandy bottoms; or it may serve as an honest warning sign of the mimic's unpalatable flesh.</p>  	 <p>"While <i>T. mimicus</i>'s imitation of flatfish is far from perfect, it may be 'good enough' to fool predators where it lives, in the world's center of marine biodiversity," says Dr. Healy Hamilton, Director of the Center of Applied Biodiversity Informatics at the California Academy of Sciences. "These octopuses can change their color pattern to look similar to—but not exactly like—numerous toxic and non-toxic flatfishes in their area.  In the time it takes a predator to do a double-take, the octopus may be able to get away."</p> <p>Undescribed by scientists until 1998, much remains unknown about the mimic octopus. Future research will focus on observing <i>T. mimicus</i> in the wild in Indonesia, so that scientists can assess the possible reasons for its bold coloration and better understand the costs and benefits of this strategy.</p>	 <p>"This study reminds us that evolution does not have an endgame, but is a continuous process," says Huffard. "These octopuses will continue evolving as long as we can protect them and their habitat from threats like trawling, land reclamation, and run-off."</p> <p><i>These findings were published in Huffard CL, Saarman N, Hamilton H, and Simison WB. 2010.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (October 5, 2010) – The California Academy of Sciences is pleased to announce that 12 new members have joined the ranks of the Academy Fellows, a governing group of around 300 distinguished scientists who have made notable contributions to one or more of the natural sciences. Nominated by their colleagues and selected by the Board of Trustees, the Academy Fellows remain members of the Fellowship for life. The new Fellows will be inducted during the Fellowship’s next meeting on October 12, 2010. They will join the ranks of such well-known Academy Fellows as Sylvia Earle, Paul Ehrlich, John Holdren, Peter Raven, and Jill Tarter.</p> <p>During the meeting, the Fellowship will also present one of its members with the Academy’s highest honor: the Fellows’ Medal. This award is given to especially prominent scientists who have made outstanding contributions to their specific scientific fields. Medalists are nominated each year by the Academy Fellows and confirmed by the Board of Trustees. This year’s honoree is Dr. Marvalee H. Wake from the University of California, Berkeley.  Brief biographies for the new Fellows and Dr. Wake are included below.</p> <div align="center">&nbsp;<br><b>New Academy Fellows</b><br>&nbsp;</div> <p><b>James R. Carey<br> Department of Entomology, University of California, Davis</b><br> Dr. Carey is Professor and the former Vice-Chair in the Department of Entomology at the University of California, Davis specializing in invasion biology and insect biodemography. His research interests in aging and longevity include the use of tephritid fruit flies (medfly) and other insect species (butterflies; <i>Drosophila</i>) to address questions concerning life span limits, effects of dietary and caloric restriction on longevity, male-female mortality differentials and the gender gap, aging in the wild, behavioral gerontology, dynamics of morbidity and mortality, and the biology and demography of disability. He is the author of <i>Applied Demography for Biologists</i> and <i>Longevity</i>, and the author or coauthor of over 165 scientific publications, 10 of which have appeared in the journal <i>Science</i>.</p>   <p><b>Gretchen C. Daily<br> Department of Biology, Stanford University</b><br> Dr. Daily is the Bing Professor in Environmental Science; Director of the Center for Conservation Biology; Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University; and Co-Director of the Natural Capital Project. Her primary scientific efforts concern the future course of extinction, the resulting changes in the delivery of ecosystem services, and novel opportunities for biodiversity conservation. She is developing Countryside Biogeography—a framework for forecasting changes in biodiversity, supported by field research, remote sensing, and theoretical modeling. Dr. Daily is also investigating Ecosystem Services—assessing their dependence on biodiversity, their susceptibility to human impacts, and priorities for their conservation. Finally, she is developing an interdisciplinary framework in Conservation Finance for assessing the scope and efficacy of diverse institutional mechanisms that aim to align economic incentives with conservation. Dr. Daily has published over 125 scientific and popular articles and serves or served on the board of editors for <i>Ecological Applications</i>, <i>Ecological Economics</i>, <i>Ecosystems</i>, and the <i>Encyclopedia of Biodiversity</i>.</p>   <p><b>Gregory S. Gilbert<br> Department of Environmental Studies, University of California, Santa Cruz</b><br> Dr. Gilbert is Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Research Associate at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama. Dr. Gilbert’s primary areas of research include applied evolutionary ecology, plant disease ecology, tropical forest ecology, phylogenetic community ecology, and cross-cultural science education. His long-term goal is to understand what shapes the structure and composition of fungal and plant communities in natural ecosystems, and to apply that understanding to conservation practice. He serves as co-director of CenTREAD (the Center for Tropical Research in Ecology, Agriculture, and Development) and also developed the UC Santa Cruz Forest Ecology Research Plot, a 6-ha mapped forest site in the Campus Natural Reserve.</p>  <p><b>Gary B. Griggs<br> Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Santa Cruz</b><br> A distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences since 1991, Dr. Griggs is an expert on coastal processes and geologic hazards. His research is focused on the coastal zone and ranges from coastal evolution and development, through shoreline processes, coastal engineering and coastal hazards. Recent research projects have focused on documenting and understanding shoreline erosion processes including temporal and spatial variations in rates of retreat; evaluating the effectiveness of coastal protection structures and the impacts of coastal engineering projects (seawalls, jetties, breakwaters) on coastal processes and beaches; evaluating littoral processes—the mechanisms which move sediment along high energy rocky coastlines; and quantifying littoral cell budgets. He has published several books, among them the classic <i>Living with the Changing California Coast</i>.</p>  <p><b>Eileen A. Lacey<br> Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley</b><br> Dr. Lacey is a specialist in mammalian social behavior, with an emphasis on rodents. Dr. Lacey came to the University of California, Berkeley in 1996 and holds joint appointments in Integrative Biology and the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Her research explores the evolution of behavioral diversity among vertebrates, with emphasis on studies of mammals. By combining field studies of behavior, ecology, and demography with molecular genetic analyses of kinship and population structure, she seeks to identify the causes and consequences of variation in mammalian social behavior. </p>  <p><b>Matthew R. Lewin<br> School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco</b><br> As an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Lewin is interested in "wilderness medicine"—accident and illness during travel to remote and extreme environments where resources are few and assistance is often far away. Dr. Lewin has participated in many scientific fieldwork expeditions and has just completed a study of illness and injury occurring during six scientific expeditions to the Gobi Desert regions in the Republic of Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. Dr. Lewin teaches emergency and field medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He has published numerous peer-reviewed articles in scientific and medical journals.</p>  <p><b>Bruce E. Lyon<br> Department of Biological Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz</b><br> Dr. Lyon’s research seeks to understand the ecological and evolutionary basis of reproductive strategies and social behavior in animals, particularly reproductive parasitism, parental care and mating systems. One focus is to understand patterns of cooperation and reproductive parasitism in birds and insects. Dr. Lyon is interested in understanding these links and identifying the ecological and social factors that promote parasitic versus cooperative reproductive behaviors. Communication through social signals is an important aspect of social evolution, and a second research interest is to understand the evolutionary dynamics of these signals and, in particular, determine the degree to which social signals are cooperative versus deceptive.</p>  <p><b>Grant Pogson<br> Department of Biological Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz</b><br> Dr. Pogson is Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. His research is focused on using patterns of DNA sequence variation to study adaptation and speciation in the marine environment. He uses coalescent approaches involving a combination of neutral and selected genes to investigate how natural selection, population structure, and historical demography can affect polymorphism within species and the divergence between species. One of Dr. Pogson’s principal aims is to understand how reproductive barriers evolve in highly dispersive species inhabiting broad geographic ranges. His research involves both marine fishes (primarily the Atlantic cod) and invertebrates (mussels and urchins) distributed throughout the world’s north temperate oceans.</p>  <p><b>Terry L. Root<br> Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University</b><br> Dr. Root primarily works on large-scale ecological questions with a focus on impacts of global warming. Her research interests include ecological analyses of the distribution and abundance patterns of species on a continent-wide scale; examining the physiological constraints on the distribution of wintering birds; influence of global warming on the biogeography of species; large-scale geographic examinations of the structure and composition of communities; applying quantitative problems; analyzing the ecological causes of rarity and commonness, and applying such information to rare and endangered species; and women in science. She actively works at making scientific information accessible to decision makers and the public. She is a former Aldo Leopold Leadership Fellow (1999) and Pew Scholar in Conservation and the Environment (1992), and she received the Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation (1990).</p>  <p><b>Stephen H. Schneider<br> Department of Biology, Stanford University</b><br><i>Note: Dr. Schneider passed away in July 2010 and will be recognized posthumously at the Fellows’ meeting.</i><br>   Dr. Schneider was the Melvin and Joan Lane Professor for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies, Professor of Biology, Professor (by courtesy) of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and a Senior Fellow in the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. Internationally recognized for research, policy analysis and outreach in climate change, Dr. Schneider focused on climate change science, integrated assessment of ecological and economic impacts of human-induced climate change, and identifying viable climate policies and technological solutions. He was a MacArthur Fellow in 1992 and consulted with federal agencies and White House staff in the Nixon, Carter, Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, Clinton and G.W. Bush administrations. Dr. Schneider counseled policy makers about the importance of using risk management strategies in climate-policy decision making, given the uncertainties in future projections of global climate change and related impacts. In addition to advising decision-makers, he consulted with corporate executives and other stakeholders in industry and the nonprofit sectors regarding possible climate-related events, and he helped to improve public understanding of science and the environment through extensive media communication and public outreach. After decades of work, Dr. Schneider, along with four generations of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) authors, received a collective Nobel Peace Prize for their joint efforts in 2007.</p>  <p><b>Neil Shubin<br> Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, University of Chicago</b><br> Dr. Shubin researches the evolutionary origin of anatomical features of animals. He has conducted field work in Greenland, China, Canada, much of North America and Africa, and he has published multiple articles in the <i>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</i> and <i>Paleobiology</i>, as well as more than 18 articles in <i>Science </i>and <i>Nature</i>. Dr. Shubin's most recent discovery, <i>Tiktaalik roseae</i>, has been dubbed the "missing link" between fish and land animals. He has also done important work on the developmental biology of limbs, using his diverse fossil findings to devise hypotheses on how anatomical transformations occurred by way of genetic and morphogenetic processes. His latest book, <i>Your Inner Fish: A Journey through the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body</i>, was published in 2008.</p>  <p><b>Peter C. Wainwright<br> Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of California, Davis</b><br> Dr. Wainwright is a comparative functional morphologist interested in the origins and consequences of functional diversity, and he is broadly interested in the evolution of organismal design. His work focuses on the feeding mechanisms of teleost fishes as a model system in the evolution of muscle-skeleton systems and the behaviors they are used to perform. His research seeks to identify general patterns, repeating themes, and principles of how the complex muscle-skeleton system of fishes is modified during evolution to produce the diversity we see in function and ecology. </p>  <div align="center">&nbsp;<br><b>Recipient of the 2010 Fellows’ Medal</b><br>&nbsp;</div>  <p><b>Marvalee H.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 15, 2010) – Global biodiversity surveys over the past few years have provided increasing evidence that our planet is in the midst of its sixth mass extinction. Plants and animals are disappearing thousands of times more rapidly than they have for more than 65 million years, and for the first time in Earth's history, human activity is the predominant force behind this mass extinction. As governments and conservation organizations around the world attempt to stem this tide of disappearing species, they face a number of formidable challenges, but perhaps the greatest among them is this—we have only documented and described an estimated 10 percent of the species on Earth, and it's hard to save a species when you don't know that it exists.</p> <p>In an effort to help address this critical need for data about the diversity and distribution of life on our planet, scientists from the California Academy of Sciences have spent the past year exploring some of the most diverse—and often most threatened—habitats on Earth, searching for new species and creating comprehensive biodiversity maps. In 2010, these scientists have added 110 new relatives to our family tree, including 83 arthropods, 20 fishes, two sea slugs, two plants, one coral, one reptile, and one fossil mammal.  The new species were described by a dozen scientists from the California Academy of Sciences along with several dozen international collaborators.</p>   <p>Proving that science still requires a spirit of adventure and exploration, the scientists made their finds over five continents (the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia) and three oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian), hiked through rainforests and dove inside submersibles, and looked everywhere from their own backyards (San Mateo County, California) to the other side of the world (the Seychelles).  Their results, published in 27 different scientific papers, come during a year of heightened international interest in the conservation of life on Earth.  The United Nations designated 2010 as the "International Year of Biodiversity" and held a Biodiversity Summit in Nagoya, Japan this October, in which 18,000 participants representing more than 150 countries adopted strategic goals to combat ongoing biodiversity loss compounded by climate change.</p>  <p>"Species loss has been accelerating in the last 150 years due to human activity, with extinction rates estimated to be thousands of times greater than average," says Dr. David Mindell, Dean of Science and Research Collections at the Academy. "Scientific exploration and discovery of new species are essential to characterizing our planet's ecosystems before they disappear forever.  Preserving biodiversity means healthy ecosystems, and healthy ecosystems are crucial to human health and economic well-being."</p> <p>A recent example of this intimate connection appeared in the December 2nd issue of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7324/full/nature09575.html" target="_blank">Nature</a>, in which a team of U.S. and British scientists found that the transmission of infectious diseases, such as West Nile fever and Lyme disease, increased in environments where the diversity of wildlife was low.  While the exact mechanisms behind this correlation remain unknown, the study illuminated a real danger to humans that results from biodiversity loss.</p> <p>Below are a few highlights among the 110 species described by Academy scientists this year.  For a full list of species, including geographic information, visit <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2010/new_species_list.php">www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2010/new_species_list.php</a>.</p> <p><b>Galapagos Legacy</b><br>  The Academy sent its first scientific expedition to the Galapagos Islands in 1905 and has since organized dozens of return trips. As a result, the Academy is now home to the world's most comprehensive collection of scientific specimens from these famous islands.  Most Academy field work in the Galapagos today focuses on the marine environment, where dozens of new species have been discovered in the last decade.  In 2010, scientist John McCosker and his colleagues described a new species of scorpionfish (<i>Scorpaenodes rubrivinctus</i>), which was collected by submersible along the islands' steep volcanic slopes 200-400 meters underwater.  Submersibles allow scientists to explore a vast part of the Galapagos that was not accessible to Charles Darwin or the first Academy scientists.</p> <p><b>Old Spiders, New Family</b><br> Although discovering new species is a common occurrence at the Academy, describing a new family of animals is rare.  Arachnologists Jeremy Miller, Anthea Carmichael, Charles Griswold, and their colleagues did just that this year, describing a new spider family called Penestomidae.  These spiders have been known for 100 years, but they were initially placed in the velvet spider family, Eresidae.  Only with the modern techniques of DNA sequencing and scanning electron microscopy did Miller et al. conclude that the penestomids belong in a family of their own.  The scientists also added five new species, all from South Africa: <i>Penestomus egazini</i>, <i>P. kruger</i>, <i>P. montanus</i>, <i>P. prendinii</i>, and <i>P. zulu</i>.</p>  <p><b>A Wasp Opus 30 Years in the Making</b><br> Future entomologists working on the Australian wasp genus <i>Sericophorus </i>will have a much easier time identifying species, thanks to a 234-page paper by curator Wojciech Pulawski.  A Danish scientist named Ole Lomholdt actually initiated this massive study in the early 1980s.  However, following his untimely death in 1999, Pulawski picked up the mantle and finished this 30-year labor of love.  Pulawski conducted additional field work in Australia, studied more than 1,000 specimens, described 30 species unknown to Lomholdt, generated photographs, added distribution maps, and analyzed the wasps' evolutionary relationships.  The result is the most comprehensive overview of <i>Sericophorus </i>ever published, including a key to 100 species.</p> <p><b>California Hotspot</b><br> Besides hosting a diverse population of people, California is also home to one of the most diverse collections of plant and animal species on the planet. This rich diversity has earned California a title as one of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots.  Four species on this year’s list were collected in the Golden State: two sea slugs (<i>Okenia felis</i> from Monterey County and <i>Flabellina goddardi</i> from Santa Barbara County); a cave-dwelling spider from the Mother Lode region of  California (<i>Archoleptoneta gertschi</i>); and a sharp-tailed snake from the Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains in the north (<i>Contia longicaudae</i>).</p> <p><b>Gigantic Extinct Otter</b><br> Ten years ago, anthropology curator Zeray Alemseged initiated the Dikika Research Project to explore the fossil-rich Awash Valley in Ethiopia.  While the project has yielded several important discoveries related to early human evolution (including the <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2010/oldest_tool_use.php" target="_blank">oldest evidence of tool use and meat-eating in hominins</a>, reported this year in <i>Nature</i>), the non-human discoveries provide equally important information about the valley's ancient environment.  This year, Alemseged and his colleagues report the only new mammal species on the Academy's list: a gigantic otter (<i>Enhydriodon dikikae</i>) from approximately 4 million years ago.  Described from part of a skull and lower jaw, <i>E. dikikae</i> was more imposing than the cuddly otters familiar to us today.  With an estimated skull length of 25 cm and a body weight of 100 kg, the extinct otter was roughly twice the size of a modern sea otter.  Its ancient diet is ambiguous, but a battery of robust teeth suggests shellfish, catfish, juvenile crocodiles, turtles, and ostrich eggs as possibilities.</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth's living things.

An international team of scientists led by Dr. Zeresenay Alemseged from the California Academy of Sciences has discovered evidence that human ancestors were using stone tools and consuming meat from large mammals nearly a million years earlier than previously documented. While working in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Alemseged’s “Dikika Research Project” team found fossilized bones bearing unambiguous evidence of stone tool use—cut marks inflicted while carving meat off the bone and percussion marks created while breaking the bones open to extract marrow. The bones date to roughly 3.4 million years ago and provide the first evidence that Lucy’s species, <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>, used stone tools and consumed meat. The research is reported in the August 12 issue of the journal <i>Nature</i>.<br>   &nbsp;     <br>   “This discovery dramatically shifts the known timeframe of a game-changing behavior for our ancestors,” says Alemseged, Curator of Anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences. “Tool use fundamentally altered the way our early ancestors interacted with nature, allowing them to eat new types of food and exploit new territories. It also led to tool making—a critical step in our evolutionary path that eventually enabled such advanced technologies as airplanes, MRI machines, and iPhones.”<br>&nbsp;     <br>     Although the butchered bones may not look like particularly noteworthy fossils to the lay person, Alemseged can hardly contain his excitement when he describes them. “This find will definitely force us to revise our text books on human evolution, since it pushes the evidence for tool use and meat eating in our family back by nearly a million years,” he explains. “These developments had a huge impact on the story of humanity.” <br>&nbsp;<br> Until now, the oldest known evidence of butchering with stone tools came from Bouri, Ethiopia, where several cut-marked bones were dated to about 2.5 million years ago. The oldest known stone tools, dated to around the same time, were found at nearby Gona, Ethiopia. Although no hominin fossils were found in direct association with the Gona tools or the Bouri bones, an upper jaw from an early <i>Homo</i> species dated to about 2.4 million years ago was found at nearby Hadar, and most paleoanthropologists believe the tools were made and used only by members of the genus <i>Homo</i>.<br> &nbsp;     <br>     The new stone-tool-marked fossil animal bones from Dikika have been dated to approximately 3.4 million years ago and were found just 200 meters away from the site where Alemseged’s team discovered “Selam” in 2000. Dubbed “Lucy’s Daughter” by the international press, Selam was a young <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> girl who lived about 3.3 million years ago and represents the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor discovered to date. <br>&nbsp;     <br> “After a decade of studying Selam’s remains and searching for additional clues about her life, we can now add a significant new detail to her story,” Alemseged notes. “In light of these new finds, it is very likely that Selam carried stone flakes and helped members of her family as they butchered animal remains.”<br>&nbsp;<br> The location and age of the butchered bones from Dikika clearly indicate that a member of the <i>A. afarensis</i> species inflicted the cut marks, since no other hominin lived in this part of Africa at this time. These fossils provide the first direct evidence that this species, which includes such famous individuals as Lucy and Selam, used stone tools.<br>&nbsp;<br> “Now, when we imagine Lucy walking around the east African landscape looking for food, we can for the first time imagine her with a stone tool in hand and looking for meat,” says Dr. Shannon McPherron, archeologist with the Dikika Research Project and research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. “With stone tools in hand to quickly pull off flesh and break open bones, animal carcasses would have become a more attractive source of food. This type of behavior sent us down a path that later would lead to two of the defining features of our species—carnivory and tool manufacture and use.”<br> &nbsp;<br> To determine the age of the butchered bones, project geologist Dr. Jonathan Wynn relied on a very well documented and dated set of volcanic deposits in the Dikika area. These same deposits were previously used to determine Selam’s age, and they are well known from nearby Hadar, where Lucy was found. The cut-marked bones at Dikika were sandwiched between volcanic deposits that have been securely dated to 3. 24 and 3.42 million years ago, and they were located much closer to the older sediment. “We can very securely say that the bones were marked by stone tools between 3.42 and 3.24 million years ago, and that within this range, the date is most likely 3.4 million years ago,” says Wynn, a geologist at the University of South Florida.<br>&nbsp;<br> Both of the cut-marked bones discovered at Dikika came from mammals—one is a rib fragment from a cow-sized mammal, and the other is a femur shaft fragment from a goat-sized mammal. Both bones are marred by cut, scrape, and percussion marks. Microscope and elemental analysis using secondary electron imaging and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry demonstrated that these marks were created before the bones fossilized, meaning that recent damage can be eliminated as the cause of the marks. Additionally, the marks were consistent with the morphology of stone-inflicted cuts rather than tooth-inflicted marks. Dr. Hamdallah Bearat from the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University determined that one cut-mark even contained a tiny, embedded piece of rock that was likely left behind during the butchering process. <br>&nbsp;<br> “Most of the marks have features that indicate without doubt that they were inflicted by stone tools,” explains Dr. Curtis Marean from the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University, who helped with the mark identifications. “The range of actions that created the marks includes cutting and scraping for the removal of flesh, and percussion on the femur for breaking it to access marrow.” <br>&nbsp;<br> While it is clear that the Australopithecines at Dikika were using sharp-edged stones to carve meat from bones, it is impossible to tell from the marks alone whether they were making their tools or simply finding and using naturally sharp rocks. So far, the research team has not found any flaked stone tools at Dikika from this early time period. This could indicate that the Dikika residents were simply opportunistic about finding and using sharp-edged stones. However, the sedimentary environment at the site suggests another potential explanation. <br>&nbsp;<br> “For the most part, the only stones we see coming from these ancient sediments at Dikika are pebbles too small for making tools,” says McPherron. “The hominins at this site probably carried their stone tools with them from better raw material sources elsewhere. One of our goals is to go back and see if we can find these locations, and look for evidence that at this early date they were actually making, not just using, stone tools.” <br>&nbsp;<br> Regardless of whether or not Selam and her relatives were making their own tools, the fact that they were using them to access nutritious meat and marrow from large mammals would have had wide-ranging implications for <i>A. afarensis</i> both physically and behaviorally.<br> &nbsp;<br> “We now have a greater understanding of the selective forces that were responsible for shaping the early phases of human history,” says Alemseged. “Once our ancestors started using stone tools to help them scavenge from large carcasses, they opened themselves up to risky competition with other carnivores, which would likely have required them to engage in an unprecedented level of teamwork.”<br>&nbsp;<br> While many questions remain about the history of tool use, tool making, and related dietary changes among human ancestors, this discovery adds a rich new chapter to the story—a story that is deeply relevant to what makes us unique as a species.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>This research was conducted under the auspices of the Ethiopian Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage / Ministry of Culture and Tourism.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (October 6, 2010) – With bits of DNA extracted from century-old museum specimens, researchers have found a place for the extinct Passenger Pigeon (<i>Ectopistes migratorius</i>) in the family tree of pigeons and doves, identifying this unique bird’s closest living avian relatives for the first time. The new analysis, which appears this month in <i>Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution</i>, reveals that the Passenger Pigeon was most closely related to other North and South American pigeons, and not to the Mourning Dove, as was previously suspected.</p> 	 <p>"This research demonstrates the remarkable potential of DNA to answer questions about species that no longer populate our planet," says Dr. Jack Dumbacher, Curator of Ornithology at the California Academy of Sciences. "The Passenger Pigeon has been extinct for almost 100 years, but with the help of museum specimens and DNA analysis, we’re still learning new information about the bird’s evolutionary history and its place on the tree of life."</p> 	 <p>Naturalists have long lamented that one of North America’s most spectacular birds was also one of the first to be driven to extinction by humans. In the early 1800s, the Passenger Pigeon was the most abundant bird species on the planet, even though its range was limited to the eastern and central forests of the United States and parts of eastern Canada. Flocks of Passenger Pigeons included millions of birds—they were so vast that they darkened swaths of the sky up to a mile wide.</p>   <p>Passenger Pigeons followed their food, settling down in forests that periodically produced a superabundance of acorns and chestnuts. The pigeons nested in dense colonies covering hundreds of acres. This made them easy targets for human predators. Intensive pigeon hunting in the mid-to-late 19th century disrupted the birds’ ability to breed. These hunting sprees, coupled with habitat destruction, rapidly drove the Passenger Pigeon to extinction. (The last of her kind, a Passenger Pigeon named Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.)</p> 	 <p>To find the Passenger Pigeon’s place in the evolutionary history of pigeons and doves, Dumbacher and his colleagues compared sequences from two of its mitochondrial genes with those of 78 species of pigeons and doves from around the world. Their analysis revealed a surprising result. Most scientists had assumed that the Passenger Pigeon’s closest relative was the Mourning Dove, a smaller species that shared the Passenger Pigeon’s relatively long tail. However, the DNA comparison showed that the extinct bird’s closest living relative is the Band-Tailed Pigeon (<i>Patagioenas fasciata</i>), a bird that is commonly found in California.</p>  <p>North America's largest pigeon, the Band-Tailed Pigeon is distinguished not only by its large size but by its distinctive coloring, with yellow legs, a patch of iridescent greenish-bronze feathers on its neck, and a yellow bill with a black tip. Despite its large size, the bird is surprisingly adept at feeding on berries and seeds in the tops of trees. In northern California, it is found in mixed evergreen forests and redwood forests.</p>  <p>The research team was lead by Kevin Johnson, an ornithologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey at the University of Illinois. Additional team members included Jack Dumbacher from the California Academy of Sciences, Dale Clayton from the University of Utah, and Robert Fleischer from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation.</p>  <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences:</b><br> The California Academy of Sciences is the only institution in the world to combine a museum, aquarium, planetarium, and world-class research and education programs under one roof.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 24, 2010) – New reports are surfacing every day about the immediate impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on Gulf Coast wildlife, especially as the oil reaches the sensitive marshlands along the coast. But how will these communities be affected over time? Scientists currently know very little about how long it takes for the hydrocarbons and heavy metals in crude oil to work their way through marine food webs. To address this issue, California Academy of Sciences researcher Peter Roopnarine is working with Laurie Anderson from Louisiana State University and David Goodwin from Denison University to collect and analyze three different types of mollusks from the Gulf Coast. These animals are continually building their shells, and if contaminants are present in their environment, they can incorporate those compounds into their shells. Roopnarine and his colleagues will study growth rings in the shells - much like scientists would study tree rings - to determine how quickly harmful compounds from the oil become incorporated into the animals’ homemade armor. They will also sample tissues from the animals over the next four months to test for hydrocarbons, and will measure changes in growth rate and survivorship. In addition to its value in informing conservation and policy decisions, this research will have direct implications for the region’s commercial oyster fisheries.</p>  <p>"We know that mollusks can capture this kind of information in their shells because of our ongoing work in San Francisco Bay," says Roopnarine, Curator of Geology at the California Academy of Sciences. "We have been analyzing shellfish from across the Bay over the past three years, and we have documented that the animals from the more polluted areas, like the waters around Candlestick Park, have incorporated vanadium and nickel into their shells - two metals that are common in crude oil. It appears that the metals can be substituted for calcium as the animals build their calcium-carbonate shells."</p> <p>By studying oysters, tellinid clams, and periwinkles in the Gulf, the scientists will be able to monitor three different pathways for hydrocarbons into the food web, since oysters are stationary filter feeders that eat mostly plankton, tellinid clams are stationary bottom feeders that eat mostly detritus, and periwinkles are mobile grazers that eat mostly algae. If the team’s results show that all of these animals are incorporating hydrocarbons into their shells at the same rate, this would indicate that they are likely pulling these compounds directly from the water column. However, if there is a difference in how quickly hydrocarbons show up in their shells, it would suggest that the animals are acquiring the contaminants at different rates through their food sources.</p> <p>The scientists collected their first set of specimens in early May from the vicinities of Grand Isle, Louisiana and Dauphin Island, Alabama, before the oil had reached those regions. These specimens will provide pre-spill baseline data for the study. Over the course of the summer, they will collect additional specimens from both sites to monitor the change in hydrocarbon levels as the oil spreads and begins to work its way through the food chain.</p> <p>As primary consumers in the food chain, oysters, clams, and periwinkles will likely be among the first animals to begin accumulating hydrocarbons and heavy metals, but they will not be the last. In much the same way that mercury becomes concentrated in large, predatory fish, the harmful compounds released during an oil spill may get passed on to the marine organisms that feed on shellfish. While hydrocarbons are organic compounds that will eventually break down over time, the staying power and long-term impacts of heavy metals like vanadium and nickel in the food web are unknown. Additionally, many hydrocarbons are known to be carcinogenic, and they could cause any number of physiological problems for animals that ingest them in high quantities. While much remains unknown, Roopnarine’s research provides a framework to answer some of these questions, by monitoring and predicting community response over both short and long time horizons.</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences:</b><br> The California Academy of Sciences is the only institution in the world to combine a museum, aquarium, planetarium, and world-class research and education programs under one roof.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (April 1, 2010) – Five dollars may sound like a small gift, but it could make a big difference to the fate of an intriguing mammal in the deserts of Namibia. The mammal in question - an insectivore known as a sengi - is most likely a new species, but scientists won't know for sure until they are able to collect and analyze DNA samples. In May of 2010, Academy scientists Galen Rathbun and Jack Dumbacher will travel to Namibia to do just this, documenting the sengi’s range and habitat in addition to collecting samples for analysis. Their goal is to provide an official name and description for this probable new species, a prerequisite for garnering protection for any animal. To fund this endeavor, the Academy has launched a "microdonation" campaign, which will allow wildlife aficionados around the world to donate as little as five dollars to support the expedition.</p> <p>There is perhaps no group of animals with a more colorful history of misunderstood ancestry than sengis - small mammals that sport the spindly legs and speed of an antelope, the flexible snout and long tongue of an anteater, and the tail of a mouse. Early taxonomists hypothesized that sengis were most closely related to shrews, since both groups of animals slurp up insects in a similar fashion, so they named them "elephant-shrews." Later, scientists mistakenly grouped these unique animals with hoofed mammals, rabbits, and even primate relatives. However, recent DNA testing has revealed that sengis are actually part of an ancient group of African animals whose closest relatives include elephants, sea cows, and the aardvark.</p> <p>While their place on the mammalian family tree is now widely accepted, Rathbun and Dumbacher uncovered a new mystery in sengi classification last year, when a colleague sent them a surprising specimen from Namibia. The specimen closely resembles other sengis from the area, but its coat provides a clue that it could be a new species. The Damaraland region of Namibia is known to house the smallest of the 17 described species of sengis, a teacup-sized animal called a round-eared sengi (<i>Macroscelides proboscideus</i>). Across its range, which extends from western South Africa and southern Botswana to western Namibia, the round-eared sengi's pelt color varies from grey or dark drown to light buff. Until recently, scientists thought that all of the sengis in Damaraland sported a light colored coat, but then Mike Griffin from Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism spotted a darker than expected individual, so he sent the specimen to Rathbun and Dumbacher for a closer look.</p>  <p>"Initial DNA sampling suggests that the dark specimen is quite genetically distinct," says Dumbacher, "but with only one specimen, it's hard to be sure." Rathbun and Dumbacher hope to confirm their diagnosis by collecting additional DNA samples from this elusive mammal during their upcoming trip to Namibia. They will spend three weeks in the harsh deserts of northwestern Namibia, where Griffin made his initial sighting. The region is so dry and isolated that the scientists will have to haul in all of the necessary supplies for their base camp, including their water. With just 80 gallons of water for drinking, cooking, and cleaning during their three-week stay, they’ll have to ration every drop.</p>  <p>"We are excited to get into the field and learn more about this unique mammal," says Rathbun, who has studied the ecology, social structure, and evolution of sengis for more than 30 years. "Is it a distinct species? Does it form monogamous pairs like its relatives? What is its preferred habitat? These are all questions we're hoping to answer, and the more we learn, the better equipped we’ll be to ensure the species is properly recognized and protected."</p> <p>If the scientists confirm their suspicion that the sengi represents a new species, Rathbun will have the honor of naming yet another new member of the sengi group.  In 2008, he and Italian colleague Francesco Rovero named and described a new species of giant sengi from Tanzania. The species, which is now officially called the gray-faced sengi (<i>Rhynchocyon udzungwensis</i>), lives in a remote forest in the Udzungwa Mountains and weighs about 700 grams (1.5 pounds) - more than 25 percent larger than any other species of giant sengi. The gray-faced sengi was the first new species of extant giant sengi to be discovered in more than 126 years. The holotype specimen, which defines the characteristics of the new species, is on display in the Academy's <i>Extreme Mammals</i> exhibit. The exhibit opens on April 3, 2010 and runs through September 12, 2010.</p> <p><b>About the Microdonation Campaign:</b><br> Donations to the Academy's microdonation campaign for the Namibia expedition can be made through the California Academy of Sciences website (www.calacademy.org/join/causes), through the Academy's Facebook Causes page (http://apps.facebook.com/causes/454920/), or by texting "SENGI" to 20222. The goal for the campaign is to raise $10,000 by April 30, 2010.

			<div id="pr_header"> <b>SNAKES &amp; LIZARDS: THE SUMMER OF SLITHER</b><p><i>The California Academy of Sciences welcomes more than 60 new legged and legless lizards<br> from May 9 – September 5, 2011</i></p>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 5, 2011) – Home to more than 38,000 live animals, the California Academy of Sciences is already hopping, crawling, climbing and slithering with dozens of lizards and snakes from around the world. But beginning May 9, 2011, squamates (the group that includes both legged and legless lizards, including snakes) will enjoy an even larger share of the spotlight—more than 60 new scaled reptiles will take up residence at the Academy this summer as part of its newest exhibit, <i>Snakes &amp; Lizards: The Summer of Slither</i>. Showcasing a variety of amazing squamate adaptations, including projectile tongues, deadly venom, remarkable camouflage, and sometimes surprising modes of locomotion, the exhibit will run through September 5, 2011.</p>  <p>"Snakes and lizards are some of the most successful vertebrates on Earth," says Dr. Chris Andrews, Director of Steinhart Aquarium and Chief Operations Officer at the California Academy of Sciences, as well as a lifelong snake aficionado. "They have survived for over 200 million years, diversifying to occupy important biological niches on every continent except Antarctica—they can even be found inside the Arctic Circle. Along the way, they have evolved a number of remarkable survival strategies and have become crucial cogs in the wheels of their ecosystems. These animals have a tremendous amount to teach us about the evolutionary history and sustainability of life on Earth."</p>   <p><b>Over 300 Feet of Snake...</b><br> Prepare to be charmed—during the <i>Snakes &amp; Lizards</i> exhibit, the California Academy of Sciences will be filled with exotic snakes from around the world that boast a cumulative length of over 300 feet. That's enough footage to stretch the entire length of a football field. The longest snake on display, an albino reticulated python that measures 15 feet long, will be stationed at the ground-floor entrance to the exhibit, welcoming visitors into the remarkable world of scaled reptiles. This bright yellow beauty named Lemondrop lacks the dark pigments that normally help pythons blend into the background while draped across tree branches. Lemondrop would have a hard time sneaking up on prey in the wild, but he stays well fed with the help of Academy biologists.</p>  <p><b>It's all relative...</b><br> Upon entering the exhibit, guests will explore the evolutionary relationships between lizards, snakes, and the rest of life on Earth. With nearly 8,000 known species in their ranks, the squamates are more diverse than mammals and have evolved to fill a wide range of niches, but they all share a few common features, including scales. (The word "squamate" comes from the Latin <i>squama</i>, meaning "scale.")  Another adaptation that sets squamates apart from other reptiles is a highly specialized hinge in their jaw. Rather than hinging on a single point like the jaws of their primitive ancestors, the flexible jaws of squamates hinge from multiple points to allow for greater manipulation of prey and a faster, more powerful bite. This evolutionary marvel allows a gecko to efficiently chomp insects and a python to swallow a pig whole. While scientists have determined much of the squamate family tree, they still aren't entirely sure where snakes fit into the picture. They know that snakes are simply lizards that lost their legs (a strategy for squeezing into small burrows and other tight spaces), but there is still debate about when and where this first happened.  Are snakes most closely related to gila monsters and their relatives, or skinks and their relatives? More research is needed to answer these questions.</p> <p><b>Sight Hounds vs. Nose Hounds</b><br> Throughout the exhibit, visitors will learn about the diverse array of adaptations that have made squamates such a successful group, meeting live animals along the way that exemplify these traits. In order to communicate, hunt, and find a mate, some squamates rely primarily on their vision, while others turn to their sense of smell. Sight is supreme for the iguanas and their relatives, a group of about 1,400 species that some experts call the "sight hounds" of the squamate world. Like humans, these animals rely mostly on vision, not smell, to find their dinners and their mates—and to figure out what other members of their species are telling them. Other than the occasional hiss, squamates tend to be silent, but the sight hounds can definitely communicate. For these animals, movement and color change are a kind of language. Lashing tails or hisses can mean "Back off!" as can head bobs and push-ups. A change in skin color may mean "I'm asleep" or "I'm looking for a mate." Chameleons—which contrary to popular belief do not change color as a camouflage tactic, but rather to send messages to one another—are among the most talented color communicators. For other squamates, including monitors, skinks and snakes, the world is alive with chemical cues. These "nose hounds" use their long, forked tongues as part of an amazing chemoreceptive system, collecting odor molecules and delivering them to special sense organs in the roof of the mouth. They use their tongues for everything from detecting the location of their prey to finding mates.</p> <p><b>Real Monsters and Dragons</b><br> Think monsters and dragons are just the stuff of fairytales? Think again. <i>Snakes &amp; Lizards</i> features two fascinating animals that take their name from these mythical beasts—the gila monster and the eastern water dragon. One of the world's only venomous lizards, the gila monster delivers a potent toxin through grooves in its lower teeth. While this venom causes excruciating pain and dizziness to the recipients of a gila monster bite, it has also improved many human lives—a peptide in the venom is used to treat type-2 diabetes and has shown great potential as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Unlike their namesakes, eastern water dragons can't fly, but they are excellent swimmers. These lizards dive into the water when disturbed and can stay submerged for up to half an hour.</p> <p><b>A Fossil Record</b><br> In addition to over 60 live animals, the exhibit also features a variety of fossil specimens and fossil casts. Among the highlights is a fossil cast of <i>Megalania</i>, the largest-known terrestrial squamate, which attained lengths up to 9.5 meters (30 feet). This ancient relative of today’s monitor lizards lived in Australia during the Pleistocene (from 1.6 million to 40,000 years ago).</p> <p><b>Touching Moments</b><br><i>Snakes &amp; Lizards</i> also offers numerous interactive stations, inviting museum-goers to listen to recorded squamate sounds, test their knowledge about these scaled reptiles, explore the inner workings of a rattlesnake on the hunt, and view videos of amazing squamate adaptations. An activity center for children encourages youngsters to engage in a variety of hands-on activities, including matching lizards to their habitats, assembling squamate skeletons, touching skin casts, piecing together puzzles, and playing science-related games.</p>  <p><b>Daily Programs</b><br> In addition to the <i>Snakes &amp; Lizards</i> exhibit, a suite of daily programs led by Academy educators will allow visitors to dive deeper into the world of squamates:<br> &nbsp;<br><b>AMAZING SNAKES OF THE BAY AREA</b><br> Daily at 12:00 pm<br>  May 9 - September 5, 2011<br> Learn about native snakes found in backyards and hiking trails throughout the Bay Area, and the important role they play in balancing their ecosystems. A presenter will introduce live snake ambassadors, and explore their habitats and fascinating adaptations for living in local arid and coastal climates. <i>Free with Academy admission.</i><br>  &nbsp;<br><b>LIVE AFRICAN SAFARI</b><br>  Daily at 1:00 pm<br>  May 9 - September 5, 2011<br> Explore Africa on a mini-safari highlighting the continent’s biodiversity, and get up close and personal with fascinating live animals and specimens. Africa sustains many types of ecosystems – from savannahs and grasslands to tropical rainforests – and highly diverse wildlife, including numerous species of snakes and lizards, all of which exist in a delicate balance with one another. <i>Free with Academy admission.</i><br>  &nbsp;<br><b>SNAKES – SHEDDING THE MYTHS</b><br> Daily at 2:00 pm<br>  May 9 - September 5, 2011<br> Snakes are both fascinating and sometimes a bit intimidating! Through the ages, they have been represented in myths, movies and pop culture in both positive and negative ways. Learn about how incredible they really are, face your fears, and discover where some of those misconceptions come from. <i>Free with Academy admission.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><b>SCALES, TAILS, TEETH &amp; MORE</b><br> Daily at 11:00 am<br> June 18 - September 5, 2011<br> Discover the diversity of hunting, eating and locomotion strategies used by snakes and lizards.  Having survived for more than 200 million years, squamates (the group snakes and lizards belong to) are among the most successful vertebrates on Earth.  <i>Free with Academy admission.</i><br>  &nbsp;<br> These daily presentations will take place in the Academy's central piazza, where visitors can also find the larger-than-life robotic snake from the 1997 movie <i>Anaconda</i>.  Signage accompanying this 40-foot-long model will explain the facts behind the fiction surrounding giant snakes.</p>    <p><b>Exhibition Organization</b><br><i>Snakes &amp; Lizards: The Summer of Slither</i> includes both new exhibit elements designed by the California Academy of Sciences and the traveling exhibit, <i>Lizards &amp; Snakes: Alive!</i>, which was organized by the American Museum of Natural History, New York (www.amnh.org), in collaboration with Fernbank Museum of Natural History, Atlanta, and the San Diego Natural History Museum, with appreciation to Clyde Peeling's Reptiland.</p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (October 24, 2010) – A new assessment conducted by 174 scientists from around the world underscores a growing concern about the health of the world’s biodiversity, quantifying the rate of decline among vertebrate species on a global scale for the first time. The team’s results support the idea that our planet is currently experiencing its sixth mass extinction—nearly one fifth of all known vertebrate species are currently classified as Threatened on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, and an average of 52 species of mammals, birds, and amphibians move one category closer to extinction each year. The team, which includes California Academy of Sciences mammalogist Dr. Galen Rathbun, notes that over the past four decades, species extinction rates have exceeded normal background rates by two to three orders of magnitude. However, the team reports that species losses and declines would have been 20% worse in the absence of conservation efforts to protect threatened species. Thus, while current conservation efforts remain insufficient to offset the main drivers of biodiversity loss—including habitat loss, over-exploitation, and invasive alien species—targeted conservation efforts have had a measurable positive impact on the planet’s vertebrate species. The research is reported in the October 26 issue of <i>Science Express</i>, the website for the journal <i>Science</i> (publication in the print version of <i>Science</i> will follow at a later date).</p> <p>The study used data for 25,000 species from The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™  to investigate the status of the world’s vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fishes) and how this status has changed over time. Their results indicate that approximately 20% of the worlds vertebrates are currently classified as Threatened (assigned the IUCN Red List status of Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable), including 25% of all mammals, 13% of birds, 22% of reptiles, 41% of amphibians, 33% of cartilaginous fishes, and 15% of bony fishes. While vertebrates comprise just 3% of the known species on Earth, they play vital roles in their ecosystems and have great cultural and economic significance for humans. The new report demonstrates that these species continue to decline at an alarming rate, particularly in tropical areas. Global patterns of rising extinction risk are most marked in Southeast Asia, where agricultural expansion, logging, and hunting are the primary forces behind accelerating extinction rates.</p> <p>California Academy of Sciences mammalogist Dr. Galen Rathbun contributed data to the report on the status of the members of the Afrotheria supercohort, an ancient group of African mammals that includes elephants, sea cows, hyraxes, sengis (also known as elephant-shrews), tenrecs, golden moles and aardvarks. Of the 83 species currently recognized in this supercohort, 30 are considered Threatened, and an additional eight species are considered data deficient—these species are quite possibly threatened, but scientists don’t know enough about their distribution to be able to assign them a status. Therefore, somewhere between 36% and 46% of the world’s Afrotheria species are currently threatened with extinction.</p> <p>The Afrotheria supercohort represents one of the world’s major mammalian evolutionary radiations. By one count, the seven groups that make up the Afrotheria represent nearly a third of all the living orders of mammals. However, the number of species within this supercohort is relatively low, totaling only about 1.5% of the world’s mammals. This means that with relatively few species extinctions, entire groups of afrotherian mammals would cease to exist, thus terminating over 100 million years of evolution in Africa and drastically reducing that region's biodiversity.</p>  <p>“Almost any loss within the Afrotheria supercohort would be profound in terms of its evolutionary significance, because the members of this group carry such unique genes,” says Rathbun. “Like many other groups, the afrotherian mammals are threatened predominantly by habitat loss and habitat degradation. For instance, all four of the forest-dwelling sengis are threatened with extinction, because the forests in Africa are rapidly disappearing.” While habitat loss and degradation are the primary drivers of rising extinction rates around the world, they are not the only culprits. The study authors noted several new threats that have emerged in recent years, including the use of a veterinary drug called diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug similar to ibuprofen that was introduced to the veterinary market on the Indian subcontinent in the early 1990s. While cattle can tolerate high doses of the drug, it soon became apparent that Asian vultures cannot—shortly after feeding on dead livestock treated with diclofenac, the birds die from renal failure. Since 1992, the population of Oriental White-backed Vultures has declined by more than 99%.</p> <p>Based on the current trends, scientists estimate that the Oriental White-backed Vulture will be extinct in the wild in less than a decade. The only hope for the bird’s survival is to establish an aggressive captive breeding program, which would enable scientists to reintroduce vultures to the wild once diclofenac is no longer in use. California Academy of Sciences ornithologist Dr. David Mindell has been studying genetic diversity in current and historical Oriental White-backed Vulture populations to help guide these captive breeding efforts and assess species status of the bird’s closest relatives. His research has provided a clear course of action for ensuring that this species survives with a healthy, diverse gene pool. Captive breeding programs are just one of the conservation strategies that are helping to mitigate species extinctions. The study authors also found evidence of notable conservation successes through legislation to limit hunting, establishment of new protected areas, and efforts to remove invasive alien species.</p> <p>“The stark reality of accelerating species losses can lead to a feeling of hopelessness,” says Mindell, Dean of Science at the California Academy of Sciences. “However, the IUCN data analyzed in this assessment show that concerted efforts by biologists and conservationists can make a positive difference in slowing rates of endangerment.  Hopefully, these findings will bolster existing efforts at conservation—and spawn new initiatives as well.”</p> <p>The research was led by Dr. Michael Hoffmann from the IUCN. The study involved some 174 authors from 115 institutions and 38 countries.  It was made possible by the voluntary contributions of more than 3,000 scientists under the auspices of IUCN’s Species Survival Commission, and a growing partnership of organizations, including BirdLife International, Botanic Gardens Conservation International, the California Academy of Sciences, Conservation International, NatureServe, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Sapienza Università di Roma, Texas A&amp;M University, Wildscreen, and the Zoological Society of London.</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br>  The California Academy of Sciences is the only institution in the world to combine a museum, aquarium, planetarium, and world-class research and education programs under one roof. This unique combination allows visitors to explore the depths of a Philippine coral reef, climb into the canopy of a Costa Rican rainforest, and fly to the outer reaches of the Universe—all in a single visit. Designed by award-winning architect Renzo Piano, the building sets a new standard for sustainable architecture. It also provides a home for the Academy’s research scientists, who launch dozens of expeditions each year to document biodiversity around the world, as well as the museum’s 26 million research specimens—essential tools for comparative studies on the history and future of life on Earth.</p>

			<div id="pr_body"> <p>SAN FRANCISO (May 10, 2010) – In honor of the second annual World Oceans Day and the 100th anniversary of Jacques Cousteau’s birth, the California Academy of Sciences is proud to present the debut performance of "Ocean Voices," an original composition by sound artist Halsey Burgund that combines instrumental music with spoken voice recordings about the world’s oceans. The piece will be debuted during the Academy’s weekly NightLife event on Thursday, June 3, with performances at 7:30 and 8:30 pm.</p>  <p>The "Ocean Voices" project was launched by Burgund and Academy scientist Dr. Wallace J. Nichols, who hope to spread awareness about the importance of the world’s oceans by helping people connect to the topic of ocean conservation on a more emotional level. Together, they created and promoted the Ocean Voices web site (www.oceanvoices.org), which they have used to collect voice recordings from around the world. On the site, they asked people to respond to one of several questions about the ocean, including "What would a world without oceans be like?" and "What does it feel like to be in the ocean?". Voices were also collected via in-person interviews, cell phone tours at the California Academy of Sciences, and a free iPhone application (http://appshopper.com/music/ocean-voices). Hundreds of respondents lent their voices to the project, including fishermen, school children, scientists, U.S. Congressman Sam Farr, and several members of the Cousteau family.</p>  <p>To create his original musical work, Burgund programmed an electronic marimba to play a selection of these voice recordings. Instead of its original note, each key on his customized instrument now plays a different voice. During the debut performance of "Ocean Voices," Burgund will "play" spoken voices on his electronic marimba, while his band backs him up on cello, violin, guitar, and keyboard.  The structure and rhythms of the 28-minute piece were inspired in part by the patterns of ocean tides.</p>  <p>"There is something about the spoken human voice that transcends the words used and the literal meanings conveyed," says Burgund. "Each of us has a unique way of speaking, unique feelings to relate and unique experiences to recount.  With Ocean Voices, I am capturing a wide variety of these individual expressions, and I hope that by combining them with original music, the resulting piece will communicate something more powerful than any of the individual voices could on their own."</p> <p>The performance will take place inside the Academy’s Morrison Planetarium, and Burgund will take advantage of the dome’s surround-sound system by "moving" voices around the dome from speaker to speaker. He will also project coastal and underwater video footage onto the dome screen, creating a multi-sensory experience.</p> <p>In addition to celebrating the second annual UN-designated World Oceans Day, which falls on June 8, the "Ocean Voices" debut will also pay tribute to Jacques Cousteau, whose underwater documentaries inspired hundreds of future scientists, including Academy Research Associate Dr. Wallace J. Nichols. "I'm just like a lot of people - I grew up with a Cousteau sticker on my bike and his films on my mind," says Nichols. "Through the Ocean Voices project, we wanted to honor the enormity of Jacques Cousteau's legacy in a way that was inclusive and open to everyone. We hope that by calling on both art and science to inspire humanity to respond to the ocean crisis, 2010 can be a pivotal year for ocean protection in many important ways."</p>  <p>Jacques Cousteau was born on June 11, 1910, making this year the 100th anniversary of his birth. Two of his grandchildren, Celine Cousteau and Fabien Cousteau, will attend the "Ocean Voices" debut at the Academy on June 3 and will give a brief talk before each performance about the importance of ocean conservation.</p>  <p>The "Ocean Voices" project is just one of the ways the California Academy of Sciences is working to increase public awareness and scientific understanding of ocean conservation issues. Although they cover more than 70 percent of the Earth’s surface and are critically important to the health of our global ecosystem, the oceans are some of the least explored and most threatened places on our planet. Academy scientists are currently working to document and map the biodiversity of the world’s oceans through ongoing projects in the Philippines, Palmyra Atoll, San Francisco Bay, and many other places around the world.</p> <p>Additional support for the "Ocean Voices" project was provided by SchoolMessenger (www.schoolmessenger.com), an innovator in fostering school-parent connections, and Oceana (www.oceana.org), the largest international organization focused solely on ocean conservation.</p> <p><b>Calendar editors please note:</b></p> <p><b>THURSDAY, JUNE 3<br> NightLife, featuring the debut of "Ocean Voices"<br> 6:00 – 10:00 pm ("Ocean Voices" performances at 7:30 and 8:30 pm)</b><br> Every Thursday night, the Academy opens its doors from 6-10 pm for NightLife, a chance for adults to explore the museum in a whole new light.

Additionally, Crucible Industrial Arts will be on hand to create underwater scenes from blown glass, and Plastic Century will be unveiled, a new installation created by scientists, futurists and artists about the increasing amounts of plastic in our oceans since Jacques Cousteau’s birth.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 20, 2011) —From sex change to cannibalism, the natural world is filled with wild mating strategies.  In a new aquarium gallery titled Animal Attraction, the California Academy of Sciences delves into the science of sex, exploring the remarkable and often surprising techniques animals have developed for attracting mates and producing offspring.  Visitors will encounter hermaphroditic banana slugs, cannibalistic praying mantises, parasitic anglerfish, and more than a dozen other creatures.  Animal Attraction opens to the public on Saturday, February 11, 2012, with a sneak peek during NightLife on Thursday, February 9.<br>&nbsp;<br> In a series of eighteen tanks, the exhibit will explore the concept that nothing in life is more important than reproductive success.  Sex—the passing on and mixing of genes—drives evolution, and is responsible for much of what we consider beautiful in the natural world.  If not for reproduction, plants wouldn’t bloom, birds wouldn’t sing, and deer wouldn’t sprout antlers. For the first time, the Academy will use iPads as exhibit labels, allowing visitors to flip through gorgeous images, watch videos of these strategies and behaviors in action, and guide their own digital explorations using interactive touch screens throughout the exhibit. Throughout the museum, Academy docents will bring these and other stories to life, sharing tales of how giraffes know when the time is right, why cacao couldn't reproduce without the help of a specific fly, and more. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Exhibit Overview</b><br>   Animal Attraction will highlight a diverse array of strategies that animals and plants have developed for attracting a partner, and passing along their genes to the next generation, including:<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><b>Extreme Mating</b><br>     Truth can be stranger than fiction when it comes to reproductive strategies in the animal kingdom.  When a male <b>Ceratioid anglerfish</b> finds a mate, he literally latches on and won't let go.  After biting into the female, the two fuse permanently, and the male will gradually atrophy until he's nothing more than a pair of gonads. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that when the time is right, the female has one or more mates at the ready. For promiscuous <b>garden snails</b>, also part of the exhibit, males who successfully fire a "love dart" at a prospective partner double their chances of paternity.&nbsp; <br><br><b>The Art of Attraction</b><br>Cutting through the clutter is serious business when it comes time to attract a mate. Male bower birds of Australia construct bowers—elaborate display arenas decorated with twigs, leaves, and brightly colored objects from berries to bits of plastic—in which to woo females with their architectural prowess, flashy dances and vocalizations. The exhibit will include a <b>colorful bower</b> modeled after an example found in the wild.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Dangerous Sex<br></b>Courtship is often at odds with survival. But the need to find and seduce a mate is one of the most powerful forces of evolution.  In some species, like the <b>praying mantis </b>and <b>salmon pink birdeater spider</b> featured in the exhibit, females will sometimes devour males before, during or after copulation, a practice known as sexual cannibalism.  For <b>coral banded shrimp</b>, also on display, the trick to a monogamous relationship is fierce aggression toward others of the same sex.  Living in pairs, these shrimp will fight their mate's potential suitors to the death.  Visitors will also get up close and personal with a <b>coconut octopus</b> – for this animal, like other octopus species, sex is a tragic milestone.  After mating, females will stop hunting in order to care for thousands of eggs, surviving just until they hatch.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Creative Parenting</b><br>Parental care in the animal kingdom ranges from intensive to practically non-existent, with numerous permutations in between.  At the climax of courtship, male and female <b>splashing tetras</b> (small silver fish native to the Amazon) lock together and leap out of the water to lay and fertilize clutches of eggs on the undersides of leaves, away from the reach of predators.  At that point, mom's job is done, and dad hangs around for another 36-72 hours, using his tail to splash water on each egg cluster at one-minute intervals, until the eggs hatch and fall into the water, at which point parental care ceases.  Depending on the species and environment, male <b>Betta fish</b> will care for their yet-to-hatch fry by constructing a bubble nest at the surface of the water, or by keeping the brood in his mouth for one to two weeks until they hatch. <br></ul><p><b><br>Additional Programs</b><br> Beyond the aquarium exhibit, visitors will have an opportunity to explore other fascinating stories from the world of plant and animal reproduction through special programs offered throughout the Academ: </p><ul><b>ANIMAL ATTRACTION NIGHTLIFE (Ages 21+)<br>     Thursday, February 9 from 6-10 pm </b><br>     Enjoy a sneak peek at <i>Animal Attraction</i> before it opens to the general public, and gain an entirely new perspective on the birds and the bees. Get to know potential mates through creative activities and games, and explore the science of attraction among fishes, insects—even humans.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 31, 2011) — The California Academy of Sciences is pleased to announce the appointment of three new curators in its scientific research division: Dr. Shannon Bennett, Associate Curator of Microbiology; Dr. David Blackburn, Assistant Curator of Herpetology; and Dr. Luiz Rocha, Assistant Curator of Ichthyology.   They will join 17 other curators and more than 100 total scientific staff at the Academy, broadening and deepening the organization's research scope with their expertise in viruses, African frogs, and tropical fishes.</p> <p>"The appointment of these three accomplished scientists will strengthen the Academy's commitment to addressing two of the most important issues of our time—the evolution and sustainability of life on Earth," says Dr. Gregory Farrington, Executive Director of the Academy. "In addition to an established track record of high-quality research and publications, all three curators—Shannon, David, and Luiz—have shown a passion for conservation, education, and public engagement.  These qualities make them a natural fit for the Academy."  </p><p>The new curators will join the Academy on September 1.  More information on each of them can be found below:</p>  <p>&nbsp;<br><b>SHANNON BENNETT<br> Associate Curator, Microbiology</b><br> Dr. Bennett is the Academy’s first ever Associate Curator of Microbiology.  In this new position, she will broaden the Academy’s research scope to include a dedicated focus on viruses and bacteria.  Her specialty lies in infectious diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans.</p>   <p>From 2004-2011, Bennett was an Associate Professor at the Asia-Pacific Institute of Tropical Medicine &amp; Infectious Diseases, part of the School of Medicine at the University of Hawaii.  During her seven years at the Institute, she led a number of research projects on virus evolution, identification, and transmission with funding from the National Institutes of Health.  She applies advanced technologies from genomics and bioinformatics to study dengue, hantavirus, influenza, and other viruses, and also bacteria such as leptospirosis and those found in mosquito vectors.  She is especially interested in the nature of genetic mutations that give viruses the potential to cause epidemics or switch to new hosts.</p> <p>Prior to her work in Hawaii, Bennett researched the dengue virus in Puerto Rico and parasitic roundworms in Texas and Vancouver.  She received her B.Sc. from McGill University and her Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of British Columbia.</p>   <p>&nbsp;<br><b>DAVID BLACKBURN<br> Assistant Curator, Herpetology</b><br> Dr. Blackburn studies the evolution and diversity of amphibians, especially frogs on continental Africa.  Nearly 90% of the 6,800 known species of amphibians are frogs.  Their diversity and distribution make them prime research subjects for investigating larger questions about the history and movement of life within Africa and the origins of natural variation.</p> <p>Blackburn’s frog research involves both extensive use of museum collections and work in the field.  His passion for the people and wildlife of Africa has taken him to Nigeria, Cameroon, Malawi, and Niger, in such diverse habitats as mountains, tropical forests, and desert oases.</p>   <p>Since 2006, he has collaborated with Project Exploration, a non-profit science education organization, to engage communities that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  With them, he launched an educational website for K-12 students called "Project Frog" detailing his work in Cameroon and Nigeria, and on future expeditions he plans to use social media to provide updates from the field.  He is also a senior associate of AmphibiaWeb, a project based at the University of California, Berkeley, that provides online information about the diversity and conservation of living amphibians.</p> <p>From 2008-2011, Blackburn was a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Kansas.  He received his A.B. in Biology from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology from Harvard University.</p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>LUIZ ROCHA<br> Assistant Curator, Ichthyology</b><br> A native of Brazil, Dr. Rocha’s research interests center on the evolution, biogeography, and ecology of coral reef fishes.  His overarching goal is to understand what drives the extremely high biodiversity found in tropical reefs.</p>   <p>He has embarked on numerous expeditions around the world, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, Polynesia, Micronesia, the Caribbean, South America, and Africa.  His field work in Sao Tome was covered by <i>National Geographic</i> in 2008, and he appeared in a Science Channel documentary in 2009 discussing the effects of radiation at Bikini Atoll.</p>  <p>Since 2001, Rocha has served as a Coral Reef Fish Specialist for the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Species Survival Commission, providing his expertise to the conservation of such charismatic fishes as surgeonfish, angelfish, parrotfish, wrasses, and groupers.  He has held positions at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and the University of Hawaii, and most recently was an Assistant Professor of Marine Science at the University of Texas.</p>   <p>Rocha received his B.S. and M.S. from the Universidade Federal da Paraiba in Brazil, and his Ph.D. in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences from the University of Florida.</p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> Founded in 1853, the Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things. The Academy has a staff of over 50 professional educators and Ph.D.-level scientists, supported by more than 100 Research and Field Associates and over 300 Fellows. It houses 26 million biological, geological, and cultural specimens from around the world and conducts research in 12 scientific fields: anthropology, aquatic biology, botany, comparative genomics, entomology, geology, herpetology, ichthyology, invertebrate zoology, mammalogy, microbiology, and ornithology.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 27, 2011) — On September 27, 2008, the California Academy of Sciences unveiled the world’s greenest museum—an eco-friendly new home featuring a hilly living roof, recycled denim insulation, and many other green innovations. Three years and more than five million visitors later, the museum celebrates another symbolic color: platinum. Today, the U.S. Green Building Council presented the Academy with its second LEED Platinum award, making the California Academy of Sciences the world's first "Double Platinum" museum and the world's largest Double Platinum building.  Designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, the Academy building houses an aquarium, planetarium, natural history museum, and world-class research and education programs under one living roof, standing as an embodiment of its 158-year-old mission to explore, explain, and protect the natural world.</p> <p>"We couldn't be more proud of the Academy for its commitment to high levels of environmental performance, and for setting the example as a leader in the San Francisco green building community and around the world," said San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee. "Their Double Platinum rating is truly a remarkable achievement for our City."</p>   <p>The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system is a voluntary, consensus-based standard for evaluating high-performance, sustainable buildings. By earning points across a variety of sustainability categories, buildings can earn a basic certification, Silver, Gold, or Platinum rating.  In October 2008, the Academy received its first LEED Platinum rating under the "New Construction" category, which focused on the building's design and construction process.  In August 2011, the Academy received its second LEED Platinum rating under the "Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance" category, which certifies that its day-to-day operations and business practices also meet the highest standards of sustainability.</p>    <p>The Academy's operations and maintenance practices were evaluated and earned points across six different categories: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation and design process. Based on a wide range of green practices and performance metrics, including transportation, purchasing decisions, and waste disposal, it was awarded a total of 82 points, exceeding the threshold for a Platinum certification (80 points).</p>  <p>Founded in 1853, the California Academy of Sciences is one of the world's preeminent natural history museums and is an international leader in scientific research about the natural world. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the Academy's original home in Golden Gate Park, but also provided a silver lining: the opportunity to reinvent the facility from the ground up. After nearly a decade of planning and the largest cultural fundraising effort in San Francisco history, the new Academy opened to the public in 2008. This major new initiative built on the Academy's distinguished history and deepened its commitment to advancing scientific literacy, engaging the public, and documenting and conserving Earth's natural resources.</p>  <p>"Our LEED Platinum building is a marvelous example of sustainable architecture that has wowed millions of visitors since we opened three years ago," said Dr. Gregory Farrington, Executive Director of the Academy. "However, it is more than just a building. It is also a stage—one that has allowed us to host a wide variety of programs and exhibits about the history and future of life on Earth. Delivering these programs as sustainably as possible helps us inspire our visitors to make sustainable choices in their own lives."</p>  <p>&nbsp;<br><b>Green Operations &amp; Maintenance</b><br> A wide range of business practices and performance metrics earned the Academy LEED points for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance.<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><b>Choice of Materials</b> <li>The Academy incorporates sustainability into its office-related purchasing decisions:<br>  -	100% of the Academy's computers are Energy Star rated.<br> -	100% of Academy's printer paper is composed entirely of post-consumer recycled content.<br> -	Nearly all of the Academy's cleaning products are green-seal certified, and all custodial paper products have recycled content.</li> <li>Materials used for facility renovations and alterations (e.g., upgrades to aquarium and museum exhibits) contain low or no amounts of VOCs (volatile organic compounds).</li> <li>The Academy uses low-emission and ozone-friendly substances for refrigeration, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and fire suppression.</li> <li>The Academy employs a prevention-based pest control program that is EcoWise Certified and minimizes the use of pesticides.</li></ul><ul><b>Recycling and Waste Disposal</b> <li>60-65% of the Academy's waste is diverted from the landfill into recycling or compost.  This includes waste from approximately 1.5 million visitors per year.</li> <li>Electronic waste (e.g., batteries and computers) is handled by GreenCitizen, a Bay Area company that helps individuals and businesses repair, reuse, and recycle electronics.</li></ul><ul><b>Water and Energy</b> <li>70% of staff use alternative transportation (public transit, biking, walking) to commute to work.</li> <li>The Academy's data center reduced the number of its physical servers by 41%, while simultaneously increasing the use of virtual machines.  This restructuring results in energy savings of 166,000 kWh per year despite a 52% increase in computing capacity.</li>  <li>Water use is 32% below the LEED baseline thanks to waterless urinals and low-flow faucets, toilets, and shower heads.</li> <li>Nearly 100% of the Academy's electricity comes from clean energy sources (Hetch Hetchy hydroelectric plant plus an on-site solar array).</li></ul><ul><b>Living Roof</b> <li>Nearly 100% of the living roof's plants and 80% of the surrounding landscaping consist of native vegetation.</li> <li>100% of excess stormwater from the roof is drained into an underground chamber where it percolates back into the water table, preventing runoff from entering the city's stormwater system.</li> <li>87% of the roof's surface area is vegetated, reducing the urban heat island effect.</li></ul><ul><b>Indoor Environment</b> <li>The Academy has implemented an ongoing commissioning plan for continually optimizing the indoor environmental quality.</li> <li>Outdoor views are available in 98% of regularly occupied spaces.</li> <li>Staff can control lighting in 93% of the workspaces.</li> <li>The Academy has installed CO2 sensors, airflow monitoring, and demand-based ventilation systems.</li></ul><ul><b>Education</b> <li>The Academy provides green building education through a variety of channels:<br> -	On the public floor, the <i>Building Green</i> exhibit highlights the sustainable aspects of the Academy building, including recycled building materials, radiant floor heating, and solar cells.<br> -	Staff and docents provide regular behind-the-scenes tours.<br> -	The Academy's Teacher Institute on Science and Sustainability, a professional development program for Bay Area teachers, includes green building in its curriculum.<br> -	The Education Division offers lesson plans and teacher workshops focusing on home energy, green buildings around the world, classroom energy audits, and the living roof.<br> -	The living roof is used for weekly public programs, citizen science projects, and research studies by high school and university students.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO — Prepare to be moved! <i> Earthquake</i>, a major new exhibit and planetarium show, will open at the California Academy of Sciences on May 26, 2012, taking visitors on a kinetic journey toward understanding these super seismic phenomena and how they fit into the larger story of our ever-changing Earth.  Occupying the entire west hall of the Academy, the exhibit will feature a number of large-scale installations, including a walk-through model of the Earth, an enclosure for live baby ostriches (yes, there are surprising connections between earthquakes and ostriches!), an earthquake simulator resembling an old Victorian home, and an interactive space designed to teach earthquake preparedness. Concurrently, a new planetarium show will launch audiences on a breathtaking tour through space and time—flying over the San Andreas fault before diving into the planet’s interior, traveling back in time to witness both the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the break-up of Pangaea 200 million years ago, and much more.<br> &nbsp;</p> <p>“San Francisco—and California too—are no strangers to the awesome power of earthquakes,” said Dr. Greg Farrington, Executive Director of the Academy.  “By showing visitors the science that underlies these natural events, we want to encourage preparedness and help visitors understand how the great movements of the continents have produced the landscape we call home today and the life around us.”<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p>   <p><b>EXHIBIT OVERVIEW</b></p> <p>The 8,000-square-foot <i>Earthquake </i>exhibit will be located next to the Rainforest dome and will continue the new Academy’s tradition of light-filled, airy exhibit spaces integrated with live animals and public programs.  The exhibit will run for several years.<br> &nbsp;</p>  <ul><li><b>Walk-through Earth</b><br> Entry into the <i>Earthquake </i>exhibit is through a dramatic, 25-foot-diameter model of the Earth.  Venturing through an oversized crack in the planet’s crust, visitors will find touchable geology specimens and interactive stations explaining the basics of plate tectonics.  Activity deep inside the planet drives the motion of tectonic plates on the Earth’s surface, resulting in the earthquakes we feel and the continental movements that happen more slowly—over millions of years.<br> &nbsp;</li>    <li><b>How Land Shapes Life</b><br>The break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea roughly 200 million years ago resulted in two large landmasses: Laurasia (present-day northern continents) and Gondwana (present-day southern continents).  The second section of the <i>Earthquake </i>exhibit will focus on the diverse life forms that evolved and spread out across Gondwana, showing visitors that the same earth processes that cause destructive earthquakes in the human timescale can also provide constructive conditions for life in the geological timescale.<br>&nbsp;<br>  Live ostriches, ancient fossils, plants, and mounted marsupials (mammals with pouches) will illustrate the shared legacy of India, Antarctica, Australia, South America, and Africa, which were once joined together.  For example, the iconic ostriches of Africa are large flightless birds whose closest relatives are scattered today in continents thousands of miles apart.  Yet they all evolved from a common ancestor, one that lived during a time when all the southern continents were connected.  Their distribution today is evidence that the Earth’s landmasses have moved great distances in the past.  To tell this story, the Academy will be hatching out live ostrich chicks, which will be on display in the exhibit until late 2012.<br> &nbsp;</li>   <li><b>Earthquake Simulator</b><br> Following a brief pre-show, visitors will enter an earthquake simulator designed to look like an old Victorian home in San Francisco.  Inside, simulated views of the downtown skyline and sounds of the World Series baseball game will transport guests back to 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989—the date and time of the infamous Loma Prieta earthquake.  A sudden tremor, lasting 15 seconds, will give visitors a sense of what this ground-jolting event felt like.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the experience doesn’t end there—the views of downtown will darken and change, and the sounds of the radio will give way to the clip-clop of a horse-drawn carriage.  For a second simulation, guests will travel farther back in time, to 5:12 am on April 18, 1906, the date of the most devastating earthquake in San Francisco’s history.  About 32 times stronger than Loma Prieta, this event brought the “Paris of America” to its knees, and the ensuing fire destroyed thousands of buildings, including the original Academy home on Market Street.<br> &nbsp;</li>   <li><b>Earthquake Preparedness</b><br> What should you do before, during, and after an earthquake?  The final section of the exhibit will address these questions through hands-on activities.  Visitors can identify crucial items for home preparedness kits (such as food, water, and hand-crank radios) and learn what to do after an earthquake (for example, checking for hazards and turning off the gas meter).  This section will also include a resource station offering additional preparedness advice from partner organizations.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>PLANETARIUM SHOW</b></p> <p>Following its first two award-winning productions, <i>Fragile Planet</i> and <i>Life: A Cosmic Story</i>, Morrison Planetarium will premiere an earthquake-themed planetarium show on May 26 in conjunction with the exhibit, narrated by Emmy-nominated actor and Bay Area native Benjamin Bratt.<br> &nbsp;</p>   <p>“Our all-digital planetarium has the ability to present complex topics—such as earth processes and the slow march of geological time—within a very visual, immersive environment,” said Ryan Wyatt, Director of Morrison Planetarium and Science Visualization.  “The new show harnesses the latest techniques in data-driven visualization to help visitors understand earth processes and think differently about living on our dynamic planet.”<br> &nbsp;</p>  <p>Starting at Point Reyes in Northern California, the show flies south along the San Andreas Fault until it reaches San Francisco.  The Golden Gate Bridge fades away as the clock rewinds to 1906.  The audience experiences an all-digital recreation of the 7.9-magnitude earthquake, followed by a scientific dissection of the event—including views of the underground fault plane and the propagation of seismic energy waves based on supercomputer simulations.  Guests then embark on a high-speed tour of the past 200 million years, witnessing the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, flying over the cradle of humanity in Africa’s Great Rift Valley, and visiting sites of historic earthquakes in India, China, and Japan—including the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.  A planetarium presenter will bring audiences even more up-to-date during a live portion showing the latest seismic events happening around the planet—earthquakes big and small occur almost constantly.  The show ends with a look at the modern building strategies used by scientists and engineers for a safer and better prepared future.<br> &nbsp;</p> <p>Scientific advisers and partners on the show include Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Geo Hazards International, San Francisco State University, Stanford University, University of California at Berkeley, and the U.S. Geological Survey.  The show will play several times daily.<br> &nbsp;</p> <p>Watch the trailer at <a href="http://video.calacademy.org/details/487" target="_blank">http://video.calacademy.org/details/487</a><br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p> <p><b>ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS</b></p>  <p>During the summer of 2012, Academy educators will shake things up with daily programs and hands-on demonstrations on the topics of geology, preparedness, and much more.  In addition, the Academy will hold an <b><i>Earthquake </i>premiere party</b> on the evening of May 25, 2012, featuring a 1906 period theme.

			<div id="pr_body">The California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park is home to an aquarium, planetarium, natural history museum and four-story rainforest, all under one living roof. New and ongoing exhibits and programs offer visitors of all ages fun, engaging opportunities to explore the natural world. All exhibits are included with Academy admission. <p align="center"><b><br> EXHIBITS </b></p>    <p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Upcoming!<i> </i><i>Skulls</i> – opening May 16, 2014 </b> <br>Every skull tells a story. As unique as a thumbprint, skulls act as roadmaps in the scientific quest to understand how vertebrate animals live, die, and ultimately, evolve. In this new exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences, explore the science of skulls—from teeth and jaws that allow animals to hunt and consume food, to eye sockets that support advanced vision to escape predators. Walk along a wallscape of sea lion skulls, watch a live colony of dermestid beetles demonstrate just why they’re known as “bone cleaners,” and discover how scientists use the Academy’s collection of skulls to uncover evolutionary clues about our natural world. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Animal Attraction </b><b>– ongoing exhibit</b><br>   From fish that can change sex to insects that eat their mates, explore some of the wildest mating strategies in the animal kingdom in this revealing new exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences. Delve into the science of sex as you encounter live animals that have evolved remarkable and often surprising techniques for attracting mates and producing offspring. Meet snails that shoot "love darts" at one another, octopuses that are literally willing to lose an arm for the chance to mate, barnacles that win the award for most well-endowed, and more than a dozen other notable creatures. Museum specimens from around the world provide windows into additional mating and courtship practices, and interactive iPad labels offer slideshows and video footage of some of the most fascinating reproductive behaviors.

He deeply encourages the participation of minorities in science. He is a world leader in astronomical research, and is one of the world’s experts on "brown dwarfs"—failed stars that are intermediate in mass between stars and planets. He uses spectroscopic studies to learn more about magnetic fields, stellar activity, and the evolution of angular momentum in the different kinds of objects he studies. He is a Co-Investigator on NASA's Kepler mission, which is already starting to discover extra-solar terrestrial planets. His main task is to understand the "noise" that stellar variability introduces into the photometric detection of extrasolar planetary transits. </p>  <p><b>Kent Carpenter <br><i>Department of Biological Sciences, Old Dominion University</i></b><br> Dr. Kent Carpenter is a professor of biological sciences at Old Dominion University. His study of the diversity of fishes of the Coral Triangle has clearly established the Philippines—and the Verde Island Passage, in particular—as the center of marine diversity. He is deeply committed to marine conservation in the Philippines and has worked tirelessly to promote the sustainable use of marine resources in the Philippines and beyond. As manger of the IUCN Red List Criteria, he is completing the first global review of every marine vertebrate species—and selected marine invertebrates and plants—to determine their conservation status and extinction risk. He is the author of <i>A Field Guide to Coastal Fishes from Maine to Texas</i>. </p>  <p><b>Sarah Cohen <br><i>Romberg Tiburon Center, San Francisco State University</i></b><br> Dr. Sarah Cohen’s research focuses on how ecological, behavioral, and environmental features shape evolution and genetic systems in diverse organisms. Currently, she utilizes genetic tools to estimate population linkages, evolution of contaminant tolerance, distribution of parasites, and immunogenetic variation in estuarine and marine species.  She is an Associate Professor of Biology at San Francisco State University’s marine laboratory, the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies. </p>  <p><b>Donald Croll <br><i>Department of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz</i></b><br> Dr. Donald Croll employs science to identify and prioritize conservation problems, working with agencies and NGOs to develop and test cost-effective solutions. His primary research focuses on the ecology and conservation of marine mammals and seabirds, and the habitats upon which they depend. He is a co-founder of the nonprofit group Island Conservation, as well as the Wind to Whales program—the seminal program of the MBNMS Center for Integrative Marine Technologies (CIMT). Within CIMT, he specializes in the examination of how physical and biological factors explain and ultimately may be used to predict the distribution of large, highly mobile marine predators. </p>  <p><b>Bruce Conklin<br><i>Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, University of California, San Francisco</i></b><br> A physician by training, Bruce R. Conklin, M.D., is a senior investigator on multiple research grants from NIH and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease.  An Associate Director of the Gladstone CIRM Scholars Training Program, he uses receptor engineering and stem cell biology to understand basic pharmacological responses. He focuses on the largest known family of receptors for hormones and drugs, called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).  From 1995 to 2001, Conklin was the Associate Director of the General Clinical Research Center at San Francisco General Hospital. He is a member of several honorary societies including the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Conklin is the founder of several public stem cell and genomics projects including BayGenomics, GenMAPP, and WikiPathways. </p>  <p><b>Todd Dawson <br><i>Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley</i></b><br> Dr. Todd Dawson is a professor in the Integrative Biology Department and Director of the Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  His multifaceted research initiatives center on the use of different physiological approaches to understanding adaptation and distribution. His research techniques, using stable isotope biogeochemistry and remote sensing, have led to many important breakthroughs in understanding the role of fog in the physiology and transport of water in coastal redwoods.</p>  <p><b>Frank Drake (Honorary Fellow)<br><i>SETI Institute </i></b><br> Dr. Frank Drake is the Director of the SETI Institute’s Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe. For over 50 years, he has been asking, “What are the chances of life existing outside our universe?”  This question led Drake to formulate an equation that quantifies the likelihood of intelligent life—communicating civilizations in our galaxy.  Drake’s Equation states that it is possible to theorize about the existence of intelligent life by focusing on known factors, such as the rate of formation of suitable stars (such as our Sun). The highly respected equation has led to other groundbreaking work in the field of astronomy. He participates in an ongoing search for optical signals of intelligent origin, carried out with colleagues from Lick Observatory and the University of California at Berkeley, using the 40-inch Nickel telescope at Lick.  He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences where he chaired the Board of Physics and Astronomy of the National Research Council (1989-92). Drake also served as President of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He was a Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University (1964-84) and served as the Director of the Arecibo Observatory.

			<div id="pr_header"><b>MAPPING OUR FUTURE</b><p><i>Using an unprecedented amount of data from museum specimens, field biologists, and the world’s leading climatologists, California&nbsp;Academy&nbsp;of&nbsp;Sciences biologist Healy Hamilton is working to predict the impacts of climate change on some of the most iconic species in the American West—and providing a valuable tool for conservation managers.</i></p>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, a map is arguably worth a thousand pictures—especially when that map can illustrate how habitats will shift over the next 100 years in response to different levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Dr. Healy Hamilton, the director of the California Academy of Sciences’ Center for Applied Biodiversity Informatics, is working with an interdisciplinary team of scientists to create maps that can do just that, leveraging both the museum’s extensive research collections and its state-of-the-art mapping and visualization software. While Hamilton and her team are not the first scientists to model the impacts of climate change on future species ranges, their projections incorporate far more data than those of previous models, resulting in maps that are more detailed and less uncertain. These high-resolution maps, which project the future ranges of key species under different climate scenarios on a ten by ten kilometer grid, are providing some of the first actionable data for conservation managers who must now plan for the impact of global climate change.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>“We know that species are already responding to the relatively small amount of climate change we’ve experienced so far,” says Hamilton, “so there is no doubt that species are on the move. The question is: Where will they be in 50 or 100 years, and how can we help them adapt?” The first step toward answering this question is to create what Hamilton calls a “climate envelope” for a given species. By inputting occurrence data from museum specimens collected over the past century and from field biologists tracking those same species today, Hamilton can establish the preferred environmental parameters for a given species, such as temperature and precipitation ranges.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>It would be impossible to create climate envelopes for every species in an ecosystem, so Hamilton chooses key species to serve as proxies for the other members of their communities. These species are often conservation targets—charismatic or iconic plants and animals that play a pivotal role in their ecosystems. While climate change will affect species distributions across the globe, Hamilton has focused her first projections on the American West, where she has created climate envelopes for such key species as the wolverine, the Canadian lynx, the snowshoe hare, and two species of redwood trees.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once Hamilton has established a climate envelope for a particular species, the next step is to determine where those environmental conditions will exist in the future. This is when the need for serious computing power and data storage capacity comes into play. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has vetted almost two dozen Global Circulation Models constructed by research teams around the world, each of which uses somewhat different techniques to predict future global climate under multiple scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. While past attempts to predict the impact of climate change on biodiversity have leveraged just one or a few of these models, Hamilton and her team are utilizing data from 17 different models to generate “future climate surfaces” with a much greater degree of statistical confidence. The IPCC climate models, however, are built at a coarse spatial resolution, typically using a grid of 288 by 288 kilometers—much too coarse to understand climate impacts on localized plants and animals. In order to create maps at a fine enough spatial scale to be useful to conservation managers, Hamilton must “downscale” each of these 17 models, using complex calculations to fill in climate data on a higher-resolution grid of ten by ten kilometer cells. Additionally, she is mapping future climate surfaces across the globe under two different greenhouse gas emission scenarios: a pessimistic scenario in which carbon emissions continue building rapidly for the next 100 years, and an optimistic scenario in which global emissions stabilize by mid-century.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>All told, Hamilton and her team have now built more than 7,000 high-resolution future climate surfaces that cover every inch of land on the planet—and have created more than a million electronic files in the process. The data storage needs for this work are so immense that Hamilton would have been unable to proceed without a hefty hardware donation from NetApp, a global data storage company based in Sunnyvale. Her new hardware system has the capacity to store over 400 terabytes of data—more than 1,000 times as much as a well-equipped home computer.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Although Hamilton’s future climate surfaces are interesting in and of themselves, they really begin to speak volumes when she overlays the “climate envelope” data from a key species to see how the range of a plant or animal is predicted to shift under both the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions. “When you look at these maps, you realize it’s not just that species are going to shift north or shift up a mountain,” says Hamilton. “Yes, in many cases that happens, but our projections show that there are also places where species exist today that should still provide suitable habitat in the future. These places, these climate refugia, should be conservation priorities.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Indeed, Hamilton has identified a number of climate refugia for key species across the American West, some of which happen to fall within existing national park boundaries. Those refugia that are not already part of a protected area network can in many cases be targeted by conservation organizations with land purchasing or management programs. Hamilton’s projections for redwood trees provide a perfect case in point. Her pessimistic-case model for coast redwoods indicates that climate conditions will become unsuitable for these iconic trees through much of California by 2090, with the exception of a few small patches in Humboldt and Del Norte counties. “Redwood trees take a long time to die, so they won’t disappear overnight,” explains Hamilton. “But new seedlings may no longer be able to take root, and eventually those forests will be gone.” However, even under this pessimistic scenario, Hamilton has identified a climate refugium for redwoods in northern Humboldt County—an area currently carpeted in redwoods that, according to the projections, should still provide an optimal climate for the trees 100 years from now. Based on these findings, Save the Redwoods League can now evaluate land purchase opportunities in this region.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Hamilton’s projections also highlight the importance of wildlife corridors that allow species to move as their habitat shifts. In January, she presented preliminary maps for seven key species at the Western Conservation Summit, a three-day meeting hosted by the Wildlands Network that brought together such renowned scientists as E. O. Wilson, Paul Ehrlich, and Michael Soulé to discuss conservation priorities for the American West. In many cases, these species will be able to find appropriate habitat even as climate change causes their ranges to shift because of the largely-intact wilderness corridor that extends from Sonora up through the Rocky Mountains and into Alaska. For instance, although Hamilton’s pessimistic model for wolverines suggests that these fierce animals will become locally extinct in the lower 48 states by 2090, the optimistic model highlights pockets of habitat within the Yellowstone to Yukon conservation corridor where wolverines will be able to survive. “When Healy presented her preliminary models to the Western Conservation Summit, I was blown away,” says Wendy Francis, Director of Conservation, Science and Action for the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative (Y2Y).  “At Y2Y we are promoting a vision of interconnected protected areas through the Rocky Mountains all the way to the Arctic Circle. Healy’s models demonstrate how critically important such a vision is to creating the conditions in which animals will be able to move and adapt in response to climate change.”<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Perhaps the most powerful message of all within Healy’s maps is the idea that the destiny of these species is not yet set in stone. “There are profound differences in the impacts of climate change on biodiversity depending on our future greenhouse gas emissions,” says Hamilton. “When we model under pessimistic scenarios, the outcomes reveal a world so different—the impacts will be devastating to wildlife. But if we can stabilize our emissions levels, and if we implement the right conservation measures, most species will be able to adapt.” Change, Hamilton says, will still happen. Species will still have to move. But the change won’t be as dramatic, and we’ll be able to plan for it. “If there’s one thing I want people to understand about these models,” says Hamilton, “it’s that message of hope—that if we take steps to reduce our carbon footprint, we can create a meaningfully better future for the other species on our planet, and ultimately for ourselves.”<br>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"></p>

			<div id="pr_header"><b><i>THE KEPLER PROJECT</i> PREMIERES AT THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES</b>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (October 27, 2011) — Motion Institute is working in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences on an innovative new performance work called <i>The Kepler Project</i>, which will be performed in the Academy’s Morrison Planetarium during the after-hours NightLife events on November 3 and 10 at 6:30 pm, and November 17 at 6:30 and 7:30 pm.</p>   <p>Stretching the boundaries of site-specific work and new technology, the piece tells the story of the mystical 17th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler. Written and directed by Nina Wise and performed by Scott Coopwood, the piece integrates spectacular visuals developed by the Morrison Planetarium visualization studio, deeply moving music by cellist Zoe Keating, and sound design by multiple Emmy Award winner Christopher Hedge.</p>  <p>The story revolves around Kepler’s unique capacity to integrate a worldview steeped in mysticism with a rigorous scientific perspective based on observation and experimentation. The story of his life, including his discovery of the three laws of planetary motion (which removed Earth once and for all from its anthropocentric position at the center of the Universe), took an even more dramatic turn when his mother was arrested for witchcraft and Kepler forced to defend her. On the way to her trial, reading Galileo’s father’s book on harmony, Kepler experienced one of his greatest epiphanies—that the Universe itself is harmonious and singing.  History, religion, passion, and science intersect in this remarkable individual’s life.</p>  <p><b>The Morrison Planetarium Visualization Studio</b> is one of the few studios in the world developing programs for fulldome theaters—especially DigitalSky-equipped domes, which make use of state-of-the-art, real-time technology to create immersive graphics tailored to individual performances.  The production team, headed by Ryan Wyatt, director of the planetarium, also includes Tim Horn, who previously led the production team at the Hamburg Planetarium, as well as Tom Kennedy, formerly of Industrial Light &amp; Magic.</p>  <p>"My work in the planetarium field focuses on the creation of 'narrative journeys,' virtual voyages in immersive environments that place audiences at the center of the storytelling," said Ryan Wyatt, Director of Morrison Planetarium. "Kepler’s story has resonated with me since childhood. The intellectual, spiritual, and social transformations in his work connect people on a variety of levels. The fulldome medium with its immersive visuals has remarkable potential to integrate an artful approach toward the history of science with pioneering visualization."  </p><p><b>Playwright/director Nina Wise</b>, since earning her degree in Religious Studies and the Aesthetics of Movement, has devoted her career to developing theater that addresses the complex relationship between body, intellect, and spirit. Her original works, performed in prestigious venues in the US, South America, Europe and Asia have won awards for playwriting, innovative design, and new theater including seven Bay Area Theater Critics’ Awards. Wise is the recipient of multiple NEA and Marin Arts Council Fellowships. She has been the Artistic Director of Motion since 1987. www.ninawise.com</p>  <p><b>Zoe Keating</b>, avant cellist and composer, is a one-woman orchestra. She uses a cello and a foot-controlled laptop to record layer upon layer of cello, creating intricate, haunting and compelling music. Increasingly considered a role model for DIY artists, Zoe's self-released albums have sold over 35,000 copies and she has amassed an incredible 1.3 million Twitter followers. www.zoekeating.com</p>  <p><b>Scott Coopwood</b> is a prodigious talent. An actor with years of Shakespearian roles under his belt, Kepler’s 17th-century language rolls off his tongue in a resonant and elegant cadence.  Coopwood’s performance is nuanced, passionate and deeply emotional as he brings the story of this remarkable genius to life. Coopwood has played title roles in <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>MacBeth</i>, and <i>Cyrano De Bergerac</i>, Iago in <i>Othello</i>, Edmund in <i>King Lear</i>, and Angelo in <i>Measure for Measure</i>. Scott has worked with Arkansas Rep., Artists Rep., Capital Rep., San Jose Rep., Center Rep., Capital Stage, The Utah, Orlando and Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festivals, The Arizona Theatre Co., The Marin Theatre Co., Portland Center Stage, The Seattle and Marin Shakespeare Companies as well as work with the Toronto, Windsor, and Oregon Symphony Orchestras.</p> <p>Wise has worked in collaboration with <b>Ralph Abraham</b>, one of the pioneers of chaos theory, on the development of this work. Ralph Abraham, founder of the Visual Math Institute, is a professor of mathematics at U.C. Santa Cruz and the author of nine books. www.ralph-abraham.org</p>   <p>"It behooves us to study the principal bifurcations of the past for guidance, such as the scientific revolutions of the 17th century," said Dr. Abraham. "The mathematical theory of catastrophes is critical, as those who understand the math of social transformation are much less likely to give up in the face of social disintegration and more likely to optimistically participate in the construction of the future."</p>  <p><i>The Kepler Project</i> is produced by <b>Motion Institute</b>, a Bay Area nonprofit theater production company that offers audiences a singular view of current issues, presented in ways that are contemporary, innovative and embedded in the narratives of their own lives.  www.motioninstitute.org</p>  <p><b>NIGHTLIFE AT THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (ages 21+)<br> Every Thursday from 6:00 - 10:00 pm<br> Proceed to the planetarium entrance upon arrival to get show passes (seats are limited).</b><br> Every Thursday night, music, creatures and cocktails come together for NightLife at the Academy. Explore exhibits and aquarium displays while sipping creative cocktails, and let exotic animals from around the world transport you to the tropics, Tibet, and dozens of other remote destinations. Special planetarium shows will take you even farther afield. Each week features a live band or DJ and a unique theme.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (April 19, 2011) —  Over the past few weeks, Dr. Brian Fisher from the California Academy of Sciences has been working with a team of volunteers in Madagascar to connect Bay Area renewable energy innovation with critical conservation efforts in one of the most imperiled ecosystems on the planet. The team helped to install a new solar electric system at the Madagascar Biodiversity Center, which the Academy founded in 2004 to promote the understanding and preservation of Madagascar's unique plant and animal life. On April 20, just in time for Earth Day, the solar energy system will be commissioned, providing hope for a brighter energy future in Madagascar.</p> <p>The new solar energy system is one of the largest in the country and will meet nearly all of the Madagascar Biodiversity Center’s electricity needs. San Jose’s SunPower Corporation supplied the high-efficiency panels for the 7.8-kilowatt (kW) system. Volunteers from SunPower and the San Francisco based non-profit Vote Solar partnered with a local solar company, Energie Technologie, to design and install the system on the Center’s roof.</p>  <p>“The solar array installation at the Madagascar Biodiversity Center will not only change how we work—it will also serve as a symbol for the greening of Madagascar,” said Dr. Fisher, chairman of the entomology department of the California Academy of Sciences and the executive director of the Madagascar Biodiversity Center.  “Our long term goal is to challenge the green energy thinkers from the Bay Area to find solutions to the problems of energy use impacting deforestation in Madagascar.”</p> <p>Located 200 miles off the coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean, Madagascar is home to an astonishingly unique array of plant and animals. An estimated 80% of the island’s species are only found in Madagascar, including such biological rarities as massive “upside-down” baobab trees, brilliantly colored giant chameleons, and more than 72 types of lemurs. Unfortunately, Madagascar’s precious biodiversity is threatened by severe habitat loss. About 90% of the island’s natural habitat has already been destroyed, and deforestation continues at a significant rate. The remaining fraction holds some of the most unique and endangered ecosystems on the planet.</p> <p>Dr. Fisher and the team he leads at the Madagascar Biodiversity Center are in a race against time to study and protect this biological hotspot. The Center has a particular focus on educating students from Madagascar in the sciences of systematics, ecology and conservation—empowering local students to protect their country’s rich biological heritage. But its work has been severely hampered by the region’s intermittent power supply.</p> <p>The new solar energy system provides the reliable electricity that Fisher needs to be able to conduct his crucial work. In addition to saving the Center tens of thousands of dollars a year in lost equipment and productivity, the photovoltaic (PV) system furthers the Center’s larger environmental mission by reducing its reliance on polluting, fossil-fuel based electricity. The connection between energy and conservation is central to Dr. Fisher’s work in Madagascar, where a principal cause of deforestation is the production of charcoal for cooking fuel. Following Wednesday’s PV system commissioning festivities, Fisher and the volunteer team will travel southwest to Ranobe, a village on the front lines of this struggle between subsistence and conservation. There they will meet with local leaders to identify future PV system sites and explore sustainable solutions for meeting the village’s everyday energy needs.</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The California Academy of Sciences is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 14, 2011) – In 2011, researchers at the California Academy of Sciences added 140 new relatives to our family tree.  The new species include 72 arthropods, 31 sea slugs, 13 fishes, 11 plants, nine sponges, three corals, and one reptile.  They were described by more than a dozen Academy scientists along with several dozen international collaborators.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Proving that there are still plenty of places to explore and things to discover on Earth, the scientists made their finds over six continents (all except Antarctica) and three oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian), climbed to the tops of mountains and descended to the bottom of the sea, looked in their owns backyards (California) and on the other side of the world (Cameroon).  Their results, published in 33 different scientific papers, add to the record of life on Earth and help advance the Academy’s research into two of the most important scientific questions of our time: <i>“How did life evolve?”</i> and <i>“How will it persist?”</i><br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Discovering new species, formally describing them, and determining their evolutionary relationships to other organisms provide the crucial foundation for making informed conservation decisions at a national level.   For example, earlier this year, Academy scientists embarked on the largest expedition in the institution’s recent history—a 42-day journey to the Philippines to survey the shallow water, deep sea, and mountain habitats of Luzon Island.  Early estimates indicate that they may have discovered as many as 500 new species.  While it takes months and even years to formally describe and publish a new species in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (the reason they are not included in the 2011 total), Academy scientists had enough initial data to provide a formal recommendation to Conservation International and the Philippine government outlining the most important locations for establishing or expanding marine protected areas.  Formal species descriptions in the coming years should help the scientists bolster and refine their initial recommendations.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Below are a few highlights among the 140 species described by the Academy this year.  For a full list of species, including geographic information, visit <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2011/new_species_list.php" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2011/new_species_list.php</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Four New Sharks</b><br>Academy research associate David Ebert and his colleagues described four new species of deep-sea sharks this year.  The African dwarf sawshark (<i>Pristiophorus nancyae</i>) was collected via a bottom trawl at a depth of 1,600 feet, off the coast of Mozambique.  It is notable for its elongated blade-like snout, or “rostrum,” which is studded with sharp teeth and used as a weapon.  The sawshark will swim through a school of fish swinging its rostrum back and forth, stunning and injuring prey, and then swim back to consume the casualties.  Ebert and his colleagues also described two species of lanternshark: <i>Etmopterus joungi</i> from a fish market in Taiwan, and <i>Etmopterus sculptus</i> from trawling at depths of 1,500 - 3,000 feet off the coast of southern Africa.  Like their name suggests, lanternsharks emit light on various parts of their body—probably a strategy to camouflage themselves from upward-looking predators and also to interact with others of their own species.   Finally, a new species of angel shark (<i>Squatina caillieti</i>) was described from a single specimen collected in 1,200 feet of water off the Philippine island of Luzon.  Angel sharks have flattened bodies and large pectoral fins resembling wings.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>A Bounty of Arthropods</b><br> There are more species of arthropods—insects, spiders, crustaceans, and other joint-legged creatures—than any other group of animals on Earth, and more are being discovered every day.  So it’s no surprise that over half of the new species on this year’s list consists of arthropods: 43 ants, 20 goblin spiders, six barnacles, and three beetles.  In addition, Academy scientists took it to the next level—literally—by describing six new genera (“genus” being one classification level higher than “species”).  These include three new genera of goblin spiders from Africa (<i>Malagiella</i>, <i>Dalmasula</i>, <i>Molotra</i>) and three new genera of barnacles (<i>Minyaspis</i>, <i>Pycnaspis</i>, and the fossil <i>Archoxynaspis</i>).<br>&nbsp;</p>     <p><b>Gorgeous Sea Slugs</b><br> Despite the common name of “sea slug,” nudibranchs are breathtaking in their beauty and diversity.    Every color of the rainbow is represented among nudibranchs, in a wide variety of patterns, making them a favorite for underwater photographers.  These animals use color as a warning sign—predators learn to associate their vivid colors with their toxic or unpalatable nature, and so they avoid eating them.</p> <p>More than 3,000 nudibranch species have been discovered and described to date, and scientists estimate that another 3,000 species are yet to be named.  Academy Dean of Science Terry Gosliner and his colleagues did their part to increase our knowledge of nudibranch diversity by describing 31 new species this year, from places as close as Florida to faraway countries like Papua New Guinea.  (Email <a href="mailto:press@calacademy.org">press@calacademy.org</a> for access to the image gallery containing a selection of these colorful animals.)<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>A Tale of Two Tortoises</b><br> In a <i>ZooKeys</i> article published this year, Academy curator emeritus Alan Leviton and colleagues, collaborating with Dr. Robert Murphy of the Royal Ontario Museum, solved the identity crisis of the desert tortoise <i>Gopherus agassizii</i>—a saga almost as old as the Academy itself.  First, by sifting through the original species description in <i>The Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural Sciences</i> (as the Academy used to be called), they determined that the species was first described in 1861, not 1863 as had long been thought.  Next, they deduced that one of the three original specimens used to describe the species was likely lost during the most devastating event in the Academy’s history—the 1906 earthquake and fire.  (A second specimen is currently housed at the Smithsonian, while the whereabouts of the third remain unknown.)  Third, they reviewed the tumultuous taxonomic history of the species, which has changed its genus name <i>five times</i> in the past 150 years.  Finally, using DNA analysis, they concluded that <i>G. agassizii</i> is not one, but at least two distinct species—one that lives to the northwest of the Colorado River in California and Nevada (<i>G. agassizii</i>), and one that lives to the southeast of the river in Arizona and Mexico (a new species, which they named <i>Gopherus morafkai</i>).</p> <p>This newfound clarity has important implications for conservation, because the geographic range of <i>G. agassizii</i> is now only 30% of its former range.  Having significantly declined in numbers over the past three decades, it may warrant a higher level of protection than its current “threatened” status.  And now that <i>G. morafkai</i> has a distinct name and its own identity, its conservation status can be evaluated as well.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (January 4, 2012) – Nature's game of intimidation and imitation comes full circle in the waters of Indonesia, where scientists have recorded for the first time an association between the black-marble jawfish (<i>Stalix </i>cf. <i>histrio</i>) and the mimic octopus (<i>Thaumoctopus mimicus</i>).<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Undescribed by scientists until 1998, the talented mimic octopus is known to impersonate toxic flatfish, lionfish, and even sea snakes by creatively configuring its limbs, adopting characteristic undulating movements, and displaying bold brown-and-white color patterns.  Thanks to these brazen habits, it can swim in the open with relatively little fear of predators.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The jawfish, on the other hand, is a small and timid fish.  It spends most of its adult life close to a sand burrow, where it will quickly retreat upon sighting a predator.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>During a diving trip in Indonesia in July 2011, Godehard Kopp of the University of Gottingen, Germany, filmed an unexpected pairing between the two animals.  Like a lackey clinging on to the big man on campus, the black-marble jawfish was seen closely following a mimic octopus as it moved across the sandy bottom.  The jawfish had brown-and-white markings similar to the octopus, and was difficult to spot among the many arms.  The octopus, for its part, did not seem to notice or care.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kopp sent the video to Rich Ross and Luiz Rocha of the California Academy of Sciences, who identified the jawfish species.  Since this association had not been recorded before, they published their observations online last month in the scientific journal <i>Coral Reefs</i>.  The authors surmise that the jawfish hitches a ride with the octopus for protection, allowing it to venture away from its burrow to look for food—a case of "opportunistic mimicry."<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is a unique case in the reefs not only because the model for the jawfish is a mimic itself, but also because this is the first case of a jawfish involved in mimicry," said Dr. Luiz Rocha, assistant curator of ichthyology at the  California Academy of Sciences. "Unfortunately, reefs in the Coral Triangle area of southeast Asia are rapidly declining mostly due to harmful human activities, and we may lose species involved in unique interactions like this even before we get to know them."<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Watch the octopus-jawfish video at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kZAgny5eg" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kZAgny5eg</a><br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Images and video available: Email <a href="mailto:press@calacademy.org">press@calacademy.org</a><br>&nbsp;</p>	 <p>These findings were published online in Rocha LA, Ross R, Kopp G. 2011.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (April 29, 2011) — Today, scientists from the California Academy of Sciences will launch the most comprehensive scientific survey effort ever conducted in the Philippines, documenting both terrestrial and marine life forms from the tops of the highest mountains to the depths of the sea. They will be joined by colleagues from the University of the Philippines, De La Salle University, the Philippines National Museum and the Philippines Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, as well as by a team of Academy educators who will work to share the expedition’s findings with local community and conservation groups. The expedition, which will conclude with a symposium at the University of the Philippines on June 8, is funded by a generous gift from Margaret and Will Hearst.</p>  <p>“The Philippines is one of the hottest of the hotspots for diverse and threatened life on Earth,” says Dr. Terrence Gosliner, Dean of Science and Research Collections at the California Academy of Sciences and leader of the 2011 Philippine Biodiversity Expedition. “Despite this designation, however, the biodiversity here is still relatively unknown, and we expect to find dozens of new species as we survey the country’s reefs, rainforests, and even the ocean floor. The species lists and distribution maps that we create during this expedition will help to inform future conservation decisions and ensure that this remarkable biodiversity is afforded the best possible chance of survival.”</p>   <p>As forests fall and oceans heat up, life in many parts of the world is slipping away. From birds and bees to frogs and fishes, species are disappearing thousands of times more rapidly than they have for more than 65 million years. As these species go extinct, we are not only losing members of our family tree—we are also losing potential medical treatments, agricultural pollinators, oxygen producers, soil servicers, and many other critical components of healthy, functioning ecosystems. Tragically, we are losing most of these species before we’ve had a chance to document their presence, determine what roles they played in their ecosystems, or discover the potential services and products they could have provided to humans.</p>  <p>Despite intensive efforts to document life on Earth, scientists estimate that more than 90 percent of the species on this planet have yet to be discovered. In order to make smart decisions about how to conserve what is left of our planet’s biodiversity, we must make a concerted effort to rapidly increase our knowledge about these life forms and their distribution. This is the motivation behind the Academy’s 2011 Philippine Biodiversity Expedition, which aims to dramatically improve our understanding of one of the most species-rich places on Earth. The 42-day expedition to the Philippines will focus on documenting life in the country’s tropical rainforests and coral reefs—the two most diverse types of ecosystems in the world—and will also examine deep-water diversity adjacent to these reefs.</p> <p>The expedition’s shallow water team will conduct most of their research off the coast of Batangas Province on Luzon Island, in an area called the Verde Island Passage. Past research by scientists from the California Academy of Sciences and other institutions has suggested that this area is the “center of the center of marine biodiversity,” home to more documented species than any other marine habitat on Earth. However, many new species remain to be discovered—Academy scientists regularly find at least one new species on every dive in this area. During the expedition, the participating scientists will conduct side-by-side surveys of marine protected areas and non-protected areas to help the government determine how successful their current conservation plans are at fostering biodiversity.</p> <p>“The expedition’s results will help our government better promote integrated coastal resource management,” said Malcom Sarmiento, Director of the Philippines Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. “The data they collect will also help us decide if and where to establish new sanctuaries.”</p>   <p>In addition to surveying the region’s fish, corals, sea slugs, sea urchins, and other marine invertebrates, the shallow water marine team will also investigate the diversity of microscopic algae known as zooxanthellae that live within the tissues of corals and many other marine invertebrates. Zooxanthellae not only lend their color to their hosts—they also provide significant nutrition as they photosynthesize and share the resulting glucose and amino acids. During times of environmental stress, such as the rising seawater temperatures of global climate change, hosts may lose their zooxanthellae, a condition known as bleaching. Bleached corals are a prime indicator of stressed reefs; hosts that have lost their zooxanthellae are weakened and more susceptible to disease and death. Sampling these microscopic algae as well as their hosts will allow Academy scientists to better understand zooxanthellae diversity and how it relates to their hosts’ resistance to increasing water temperatures and other environmental stress.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the expedition’s terrestrial team will be busy surveying rainforest habitats in several different locations across Luzon Island, including forests on Mt. Banahaw, Mt. Makiling, Mt. Tabayoc, and Mt. Pulag. These high-elevation peaks are home to some of the most pristine cloud forest habitat in the Philippines and provide a refuge for a great many plant and animal species. While scientists have conducted limited survey work on most of these mountains before, especially to document larger animals like birds and mammals, these regions have never been explored by a multi-disciplinary scientific team on this scale. Indeed, there is no comprehensive list of plants for any of these forests, and no surveys have ever been conducted for insects or arachnids.</p>  <p>The terrestrial team scientists will focus on identifying and mapping flowering plants, mosses, spiders, insects, amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals. Many of these groups are known to have high levels of species diversity and endemism (meaning they cannot be found anywhere else on Earth), and it is likely that many new species remain to be discovered.  All of them are threatened by human population pressure and natural resource exploitation—even inside the boundaries of many national parks, where logging and subsistence farming are fairly regular occurrences. The team’s research will help the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in the Philippines better manage their protected areas and enforce their conservation policies. Additionally, the expedition’s educators will organize meetings with local schools, community groups, and national park employees in order to foster appreciation for and deeper knowledge about the spectacular biodiversity in their backyards.</p>   <p>During the deep-sea portion of the expedition, the scientists will board a research vessel owned by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, the M/V BA-BFAR, and set out to conduct a survey of the deep waters around Lubang Island. Scientists have only recently begun to explore the deep sea, and the vast majority of deep sea organisms remain to be discovered. Indeed, far less than 1 percent of the world’s deep sea environments have been scientifically investigated.  Over the course of eight days, the expedition’s deep-sea marine team will survey the waters around Lubang Island at depths of up to 2,000 meters in search of deep-sea fish, corals, barnacles, sea stars, and other invertebrates. While sorting specimens on the deck of the boat, the scientists are sure to find a wide variety of strange species that have never before been documented.</p> <p>On June 8, the Academy’s 2011 Philippine Biodiversity Expedition will conclude with a symposium at the University of the Philippines, during which the preliminary results from the expedition will be presented. The symposium, titled “The Status of Philippine Biodiversity in the Face of Climate Change: State of Knowledge and Conservation Challenges,” will also include an examination of the current challenges with respect to conservation of the Philippines’ unique biota, as well as discussion about more effective strategies to mitigate the projected impacts of climate change.</p>  <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The California Academy of Sciences is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 24, 2011) — This spring, scientists from the California Academy of Sciences braved leeches, lionfish, whip-scorpions and a wide variety of other biting and stinging creatures to lead the most comprehensive scientific survey effort ever conducted in the Philippines, documenting both terrestrial and marine life forms from the tops of the highest mountains to the depths of the sea. They were joined on this unprecedented, multi-disciplinary undertaking by more than two dozen colleagues from the Philippines, as well as by a team of Academy educators who worked to share the expedition’s findings with local community and conservation groups. Over the course of the expedition, which was funded by a generous gift from Margaret and Will Hearst, the scientists discovered more than 300 species that are likely new to science, including dozens of new insects and spiders, deep-sea armored corals, ornate sea pens, bizarre new sea urchins and sea stars, a shrimp-eating swell shark, and over 50 colorful new sea slugs. These discoveries will be confirmed and described over the coming months, as the scientists use both microscopes and DNA sequencing to analyze their specimens.</p>  <p>“The Philippines is one of the hottest of the hotspots for diverse and threatened life on Earth,” says Dr. Terrence Gosliner, Dean of Science and Research Collections at the California Academy of Sciences and leader of the 2011 Philippine Biodiversity Expedition. “Despite this designation, however, the biodiversity here is still relatively unknown, and we found new species during nearly every dive and hike as we surveyed the country’s reefs, rainforests, and the ocean floor. The species lists and distribution maps that we created during this expedition will help to inform future conservation decisions and ensure that this remarkable biodiversity is afforded the best possible chance of survival.”</p>   <p>Despite intensive efforts to document life on Earth, scientists estimate that more than 90 percent of the species on this planet have yet to be discovered. In the face of large-scale habitat loss and degradation, many of these species are disappearing before we even know they exist. As they join the ranks of the extinct, we are not only losing members of our family tree—we are also losing potential medical treatments, agricultural pollinators, oxygen producers, soil servicers, and many other critical components of healthy, functioning ecosystems. In order to make smart decisions about how to conserve what is left of our planet’s biodiversity, we must make a concerted effort to rapidly increase our knowledge about these life forms and their distribution. This was the motivation behind the Academy’s 2011 Philippine Biodiversity Expedition, which aimed to dramatically improve our understanding of one of the most species-rich places on Earth.</p>  <p>During their 42-day expedition to survey Luzon Island—the largest island in the Philippine archipelago—and its surrounding waters, the international team of scientists created species lists and distribution maps for a wide variety of species, including plants, insects, spiders, reptiles, amphibians, fish, corals, barnacles, sea urchins and many other marine invertebrates. Along the way, they encountered more than 300 species that appear to be new to science, including such notable finds as a cicada that makes a distinctive “laughing” call, a deep-sea swell shark that inflates its stomach with water to bulk up and scare off other predators, a starfish that exclusively eats sunken driftwood, three new lobster relatives that squeeze into crevices instead of carrying shells on their backs, a crab whose pincers are lined with needle-like teeth, and a worm-like pipefish that hides among colonies of soft coral. Many of the new species avoided previous detection because of their diminutive size, such as goblin spiders, sea slugs, and barnacles that all measure just a few millimeters in length. Others simply exist in places that are rarely, if ever, visited by humans, such as a snake eel from the bottom of the ocean and a primitive plant called a spikemoss from the dangerously steep upper slopes of Mt. Isarog. All of the new species add weight to the idea that the Philippines is a critically important haven for biodiversity, and that its waters likely house more species than any other marine environment on Earth.</p>  <p>Unlike the traditional expedition model, in which results are often not published or shared until months or years after the field work has concluded, the participants in the Academy’s 2011 Philippine Biodiversity Expedition began the process of communicating about their results while they were still in the Philippines. With the help of a team of Academy educators, they conducted outreach sessions in each of the communities closest to the expedition’s survey sites, sharing their preliminary findings with local teachers, politicians, and conservation workers. At the end of the expedition on June 8, they held a full-day symposium at the University of the Philippines to share these results more widely and discuss initial conservation recommendations. Since then, the scientists have integrated their data and provided a formal recommendation to key partners such as Conservation International, the Philippines Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau, the Philippines Department of the Environment and Natural Resources, and the Bureau of Fishers and Aquatic Resources outlining the most important locations for establishing or expanding marine protected areas, as well as suggested areas for reforestation to reduce sedimentation damage to the reefs. They also identified reduction of plastic waste as a conservation priority, since plastic litter was pervasive throughout the marine environment, even on the ocean floor at depths of over 6,000 feet. Additionally, the team’s terrestrial surveys and species lists will help UNESCO and other conservation organizations make a compelling case for funding to enforce the existing protected areas on land, many of which are currently only “paper parks” with no means of preventing deforestation, hunting and other technically prohibited activities.</p>  <p>Over the next few months, the expedition scientists will be hard at work analyzing the specimens they collected during their field work—and undoubtedly discovering more new species along the way. In the meantime, they will present their preliminary results to the San Francisco public for the first time on June 30, during the Academy’s weekly NightLife event.</p>  <p>&nbsp;<br><b>Expedition NightLife<br> Thursday, June 30<br>  6:00 – 10:00 pm</b><br> This week, NightLife celebrates the Academy’s landmark research expedition to the Philippines.

			<div id="pr_body">  SAN FRANCISCO (July 5, 2011) —Like a smartphone, once you have penguins in your pocket, you'll wonder how you ever got along without them. Launching today, Pocket Penguins, an app designed and developed by the California Academy of Sciences, will offer users live views of its colony of charismatic African Penguins 24 hours a day. <br>&nbsp;<br>Users can toggle between three different cameras in the exhibit, including an underwater vantage point, and watch for natural behaviors including courting, establishing and defending territories, and collecting nest material. The next time a couple produces and begins incubating eggs, biologists plan to deploy a nest cam to share the egg incubation and chick rearing process with viewers around the world. <br>&nbsp;<br><ul><li>Insider Tip: The birds are especially animated during feeding time (daily at 10:30am and 3:00pm PST). Tune in during feeding time on Thursday, July 7 to see Academy staff and visitors wish Pete, one of the colony's youngest birds, a happy fourth birthday.  </li></ul>&nbsp;<br>The free app is now available for iPhones and Android phones via the iTunes Store and Android Market. For links and details, visit <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/apps/penguins" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/apps/penguins</a>. The penguin cams are also available online at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/webcams/penguins/" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/webcams/penguins/</a>, and visitors to the Academy can see the birds in-person in African Hall. <br> &nbsp;<br><b>About African Penguins</b><br>   The Academy participates in the American Zoo and Aquarium Association’s Species Survival Program (SSP) for African Penguins, aimed at conserving this species in the wild. In 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified the species as endangered, or at very high risk of extinction in the wild. African Penguin populations are threatened by competition with commercial fishing operations, guano removal, oil spills, and predation by feral cats.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br>   Located in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the California Academy of Sciences is home to Steinhart Aquarium, Morrison Planetarium, Kimball Natural History Museum, and world-class research and education programs—all under one living roof.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (November 8, 2011) — Is it possible to travel back in time to see your surroundings from the perspective of another species? This question sparked the basis for <i>Valley Oaks: An Ecological Journey Through Time</i>, an interactive tour from the canopy to the cosmos that will be shown in Morrison Planetarium on December 8, 2011, at 6:30 pm.  Located inside the California Academy of Sciences, Morrison Planetarium has transported audiences to the far reaches of the Universe and back with feature shows such as <i>Fragile Planet</i> and <i>Life: A Cosmic Story</i>. <i>Valley Oaks</i> will bring together both public audiences and regional partners, engaging them in a dialogue about conserving an iconic California tree species.  It will also be simulcast to up to 10 partner institutions nationwide, replicating the experience of touring Bay Area ecosystems to partners as far away as South Dakota and North Carolina, but controlled by presenters in San Francisco.</p>  <p><i>Valley Oaks</i> is the third event in the Worldviews Network, a NOAA-funded collaboration of scientists, artists, and educators focused on developing best practices for using immersive virtual environments, such as Morrison Planetarium, for ecological literacy education.  The first event was held in May 2011 at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science on the topic of water issues in the western United States; the second event was held in September 2011 at the Land of Sky Regional Council headquarters in Asheville, North Carolina, on the topic of livable communities in the southern Appalachian mountains.  <i>Valley Oaks</i> will be the first Worldviews event hosted on the West Coast.</p>  <p>The content for <i>Valley Oaks</i> springs from a collaboration between biologists and visualization experts at the Academy and historical ecologists and indigenous partners at the San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI - www.sfei.org), an environmental research organization located in Oakland, California. The presentation will feature rarely seen historical maps and photos of the Bay Area from SFEI’s archives, Academy specimen collections, and environmental data.  Live presenters will take audiences on a journey through time and space, exploring our deep connection to trees through the history and ecology of the Valley oak (<i>Quercus lobata</i>). This California endemic tree was once widespread in the Bay Area but is now reduced to 1% of its former habitat after significant human settlement began in the 1800s.  However, efforts to “re-oak” these developed landscapes by planting Valley oaks throughout the region are currently underway. After the presentation, audience members can participate in a discussion with scientists, indigenous peoples, and conservationists to learn how to get involved in restoring and reintegrating Valley oaks into California’s suburban and agricultural landscapes.</p>  <p>Additional funding from the Yahoo Employee Foundation and the Christensen Fund supports the collaboration between the Academy and SFEI.  The collaboration will continue through 2012 with a series of outreach programs focused on connecting audiences to the California landscape and inspiring their participation in shaping its future. </p>   <p><b>FOR CALENDAR EDITORS:</b></p>  <p><b><i>Valley Oaks: An Ecological Journey Through Time</i><br> Thursday, December 8 at 6:30 pm, during NightLife at the California Academy of Sciences<br> Proceed to the planetarium entrance upon arrival to get your show passes.</b><br> Take an immersive tour from the canopy to the cosmos inside Morrison Planetarium, and explore the history and ecology of one of California’s most iconic and threatened tree species, the Valley oak.  Academy scientists, indigenous partners, and historical ecologists will reveal how Valley oaks and humans are intertwined in a relationship of disturbance and adaptation, with implications for the health and well-being of Bay Area communities.  The first NOAA-funded Worldviews Network event on the West Coast, this program will be simulcast to partner institutions across the United States.  A post-presentation dialogue will be held with regional partners and public audiences after the show.<br><i>Included with NightLife admission; seats are limited and show passes are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.

With the advent of canopy access techniques such as construction cranes and hot-air balloons, scientists have been able to document the highly diverse communities of plants, animals, and fungi that dwell 100 meters above the forest floor. Dr. Nadkarni has been a pioneer in exploring this "third dimension" of forests on four continents, supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society. Her lecture will document the development of the field of canopy studies, and her own ecological work to understand this "last biotic frontier."

It is a system of agriculture involving the simultaneous cultivation of plants and aquatic animals in a symbiotic environment. In traditional aquaculture, animal effluents accumulate in the water and continue to increase the water’s toxicity. In aquaponics, this water is led to a hydroponic system where the by-products from the aquaculture are filtered out by the plants as vital nutrients. This results in clean water which is circulated back to the animals. The synergy of these two systems combined far exceeds the productivity of either one as a stand alone system. In this talk, you can learn how to produce food in a nearly closed loop system that requires 95% less water than traditional farming and doesn’t even require soil. <i>Free with museum admission; seating is limited - to reserve a place, visit <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/event_tickets" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/event_tickets</a>, or call 800-794-7576.

Next, his team built the genome of a bacterium from scratch and incorporated it into a cell to make what they call the world's first synthetic life form. This achievement heralds the dawn of a new era in which new life could be made to benefit humanity, starting with bacteria that churn out biofuels, soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and even manufacture vaccines. J. Craig Venter, Ph.D., is regarded as one of the leading scientists of the 21st century for his numerous invaluable contributions to genomic research. He is Founder and President of the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), a not-for-profit, research and support organization with more than 400 scientists and staff dedicated to human, microbial, plant and environmental genomic research, the exploration of social and ethical issues in genomics, and seeking alternative energy solutions through genomics.

As a result, he can effortlessly move from a discussion of pecking orders in primate societies (human and baboon) to an explanation of how neurotransmitters work during stress—and he get laughs doing it. In fact, he chose to live with baboons because they are perfect for learning about stress and stress-related diseases in humans. Like their human cousins, baboons live in large, complex social groups and have lots of time, Dr. Sapolsky writes, “to devote to being rotten to each other.” Just like stressed-out people, stressed-out baboons have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and hardened arteries. And just like people, baboons are good material for stories. His gift for storytelling led The New York Times to suggest, “if you crossed Jane Goodall with a borscht-belt comedian, she might have written a book like A Primate’s Memoir,” an account of his early years as a field biologist. Dr. Sapolsky is a MacArthur “Genius” Fellow.

Among the key questions are the timing and patterns associated with the emergence of upright walking, tool use, and meat eating. <i>7:00 pm; Tickets are $12 adults, $10 seniors, free for members; to reserve a place, visit <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/event_tickets" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/event_tickets</a>, or call 800-794-7576; California Academy of Sciences, 55 Music Concourse Drive, Golden Gate Park.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><b>MONDAY, MARCH 14 at 7:30 pm<br>   Benjamin Dean Lecture</b><br>   Check <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/event_tickets" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/event_tickets</a> for the latest speaker information for this series of talks by noted scientists in the fields of astronomy and space science. <i>Tickets are $12 for non-member adults, $10 for non-member seniors, and $6 for members.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (March 27, 2012) – Herpetologists from the California Academy of Sciences and University of Texas at El Paso discovered a single specimen of the Bururi long-fingered frog (<i>Cardioglossa cyaneospila</i>) during a research expedition to Burundi in December 2011.  The frog was last seen by scientists in 1949 and was feared to be extinct after decades of turmoil in the tiny East African nation.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>For biologists studying the evolution and distribution of life in Africa, Burundi sits at an intriguing geographic crossroads since it borders the vast Congo River Basin, the Great Rift Valley, and the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Tanganyika.  Many of the species in its high-elevation forests may be closely related to plants and animals found in Cameroon’s mountains, suggesting that at some point in the past, a cooler climate may have allowed the forests to become contiguous.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Previous knowledge of Burundi’s wildlife came from scientific surveys conducted in the mid-20th century, when the nation was under Belgian administration.  But its history since then has been one of political unrest, population growth, and habitat loss.  Today, approximately 10 million people occupy an area the size of Massachusetts, giving Burundi one of the highest population densities in Africa.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Academy curator David Blackburn joined his colleague Eli Greenbaum, professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, on the 2011 expedition with the goal of finding <i>Cardioglossa cyaneospila</i>, as well as other amphibians and reptiles first described 60 years ago.  To their pleasant surprise, the habitats of the Bururi Forest Reserve in the southwest part of the country were still relatively intact, with populations of rare forest birds and chimpanzees present.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>With little knowledge to go on except a hunch that <i>C. cyaneospila</i> would make a call like its possible close relatives in Cameroon, Blackburn finally found a single specimen on his fifth night in the forest.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>“I thought I heard the call and walked toward it, then waited,” said Blackburn.  “In a tremendous stroke of luck, I casually moved aside some grass and the frog was just sitting there on a log.  I heard multiple calls over the next few nights, indicating a healthy population of the species, but I was only able to find this one specimen.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Bururi long-fingered frog is about 1.5 inches long, with a black and bluish-gray coloration.  The males are notable for one extra-long finger on each foot, analogous to the “ring finger” in humans, whose purpose is unknown.  Its closest relatives live in the mountains of Cameroon, more than 1,400 miles away.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The lone specimen collected, which now resides in the Academy’s herpetology collection, can be used for DNA studies to determine how long the <i>Cardioglossa </i>species from Burundi and Cameroon have been genetically isolated from one another.  The results will shed light on Africa’s historical climate conditions, a topic that has far-reaching implications for understanding the evolution of life in the continent that gave rise to our own species.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In addition to locating the Bururi long-fingered frog, Blackburn and Greenbaum also documented dozens of other amphibians in Burundi, many of which had never before been recorded in the country.  The team also discovered some species that may be new to science.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Eventually, we will use the data from our expedition to update the IUCN conservation assessment for amphibians of Burundi,” said Greenbaum.  “Because Burundi is poorly explored, we’ve probably doubled the number of amphibian species known from the country.  Once we demonstrate that Burundi contains rare and endemic species, we can work with the local community to make a strong case for preserving their remaining natural habitats.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Images available:</b> Email <a href="mailto:press@calacademy.org">press@calacademy.org</a><br>&nbsp;</p>	  <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things.

			<div id="pr_header"><b>NEW SPECIES OF DEEP-SEA CATSHARK DESCRIBED FROM THE GALAPAGOS</b>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (March 7, 2012) – Scientists conducting deep-sea research in the Galapagos have described a new species of catshark, <i>Bythaelurus giddingsi</i>, in the March 5 issue of the journal <i>Zootaxa</i>.  The new shark is approximately a foot long and has a chocolate-brown coloration with pale, irregularly distributed spots on its body.   The spotted patterns appear to be unique to each individual. John McCosker of the California Academy of Sciences collected the first specimens of this new catshark while diving to depths of 1,400 - 1,900 feet aboard the <i>Johnson Sea-Link</i> submersible.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“The discovery of a new shark species is always interesting, particularly at this time when sharks are facing such incredible human pressure,” said McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the Academy and lead author on the paper.  “Many species have become locally rare and others verge on extinction due to their capture for shark-fin soup. The damage to food webs is dramatic, since sharks provide valuable ecological services as top-level predators—when they disappear, their niche is often filled by other species that further imbalance ecosystems. Most deepwater shark species are not very susceptible to overfishing; however, since this catshark’s range is restricted to the Galapagos, its population is likely limited in size, making it more susceptible than more widely distributed species.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The California Academy of Sciences sent its first scientific expedition to the Galapagos Islands in 1905 and has since organized dozens of return trips. As a result, the Academy is now home to the world’s most comprehensive collection of scientific specimens from these famous islands.  Most Academy field work in the Galapagos today focuses on the marine environment, where dozens of new species have been discovered in recent decades.  In the 1990s, McCosker made a series of dives inside the submersible <i>Johnson Sea-Link</i> to explore the marine life on the islands’ steep volcanic slopes and sandy bottoms.  Submersibles allow scientists to explore a vast part of the Galapagos that was not accessible to Charles Darwin or earlier Academy scientists.  It was during two such dives in 1995 and 1998 that McCosker collected the seven specimens used to describe <i>B. giddingsi</i>. Using research collections at the Academy and elsewhere as a basis for comparison, Academy Research Associate Douglas Long and Smithsonian Institution scientist Carole Baldwin worked with McCosker to confirm that the specimens did indeed represent a new species.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>McCosker’s marine research in the Galapagos was the subject of a 1996 Discovery Channel documentary called <i>Galapagos: Beyond Darwin</i>. The new shark is named in honor of award-winning filmmaker Al Giddings, who filmed and produced the Discovery Channel project and many more natural history films. McCosker’s deep-sea research in the Galapagos is also highlighted within the Academy’s <i>Islands of Evolution</i> exhibit, which opened in 2008.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Images available: Email <a href="mailto:press@calacademy.org">press@calacademy.org</a><br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>These findings were published in McCosker JE, Long DJ, Baldwin CC. 2012.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>October 29, 2012 – The Cretaceous Period of Earth history ended with a mass extinction that wiped out numerous species, most famously the dinosaurs. A new study now finds that the structure of North American ecosystems made the extinction worse than it might have been. Researchers at the University of Chicago, the California Academy of Sciences, and the Field Museum of Natural History published their findings Oct. 29 online in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The mountain-sized asteroid that left the now-buried Chicxulub impact crater on the coast of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula is almost certainly the ultimate cause of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, which occurred 65 million years ago. Nevertheless, “Our study suggests that the severity of the mass extinction in North America was greater because of the ecological structure of communities at the time,” noted lead author Jonathan Mitchell, a Ph.D. student of UChicago’s Committee on Evolutionary Biology.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Mitchell and his co-authors, Peter Roopnarine of the California Academy of Sciences and Kenneth Angielczyk of the Field Museum, reconstructed terrestrial food webs for 17 Cretaceous ecological communities. Seven of these food webs existed within 2 million years of the Chicxulub impact, and ten came from the preceding 13 million years.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The findings are based on a computer model showing how disturbances spread through the food web. Roopnarine developed the simulation to predict how many animal species would become extinct from a plant die-off, a likely consequence of the impact.<br>&nbsp;</p>	  <p>“Our analyses show that more species became extinct for a given plant die-off in the youngest communities,” Mitchell said. “We can trace this difference in response to changes in a number of key ecological groups such as plant-eating dinosaurs like <i>Triceratops </i>and small mammals.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The results of Mitchell and his colleagues paint a picture of late Cretaceous North America in which pre-extinction changes to food webs — likely driven by a combination of environmental and biological factors — results in communities that were more fragile when faced with large disturbances.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Besides shedding light on this ancient extinction, our findings imply that seemingly innocuous changes to ecosystems caused by humans might reduce the ecosystems’ abilities to withstand unexpected disturbances,” Roopnarine said.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The team’s computer model describes all plausible diets for the animals under study. In one run, <i>Tyrannosaurus </i>might eat only <i>Triceratops</i>, while in another it eats only duck-billed dinosaurs, and in a third it might eat a more varied diet. This stems from the uncertainty regarding exactly what Cretaceous animals ate, but this uncertainty actually worked to the study’s benefit.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Using modern food webs as guides, what we have discovered is that this uncertainty is far less important to understanding ecosystem functioning than is our general knowledge of the diets and the number of different species that would have had a particular diet,” Angielczyk said.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Data derived from modern food webs helped the simulations account for such phenomena as how specialized animals tend to be, or how body size relates to population size and thus their probability of extinction.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The researchers also selected for their study a large number of specific food webs from all the specific webs possible in their general framework and evaluated how this sample of webs respond to a perturbation, such as the death of plants. They used the same relationships and assumptions to create food webs across all of the different sites, which means the differences between sites just stem from differences in the data rather than from the simulation itself. This makes the simulation a fundamentally comparative method, Roopnarine noted.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“We aren’t trying to say that a given ecosystem was fragile, but instead that a given ecosystem was more or less fragile than another,” he said.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The computer models showed that if the asteroid hit during the 13 million years preceding the latest Cretaceous communities, there almost certainly would still have been a mass extinction, but one that likely would have been less severe in North America.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Most likely a combination of changing climate and other environmental factors caused some types of animals to become more or less diverse in the Cretaceous, the researchers concluded. In their paper they suggest that the drying up of a shallow sea that covered part of North America may have been one of the main factors leading to the observed changes in diversity.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The study provides no evidence that the latest Cretaceous communities were on the verge of collapse before the asteroid hit. “The ecosystems collapsed because of the asteroid impact, and nothing in our study suggests that they would not have otherwise continued on successfully,” Mitchell said. “Unusual circumstances, such as the after-effects of the asteroid impact, were needed for the vulnerability of the communities to become important.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The study has implications for modern conservation efforts, Angielczyk observed.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>“Our study shows that the robustness or fragility of an ecosystem under duress depends very much on both the number of species present, as well as the types of species,” he said, referring to their ecological function. The study also shows that more is not necessarily better, because simply having many species does not insure against ecosystem collapse.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“What you have is also important,” Angelczyk said. “It is therefore critical that conservation efforts pay attention to ecosystem functioning and the roles of species in their communities as we continue to degrade our modern ecosystems.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <div align="center">***</div>  <p><b>Citation:</b> “Late Cretaceous restructuring of terrestrial communities facilitated the End-Cretaceous mass extinction in North America,” by Jonathan S.

			<div id="pr_body"> <p>SAN FRANCISCO (March 23, 2012) – The California Academy of Sciences is committed to exploring, explaining and protecting the natural world throughout the year, but for Earth Day, that spotlight on our planet’s health intensifies. From April 21 - 26, the Academy will host a series of special programs which highlight our planet’s incredible biodiversity and fragility. Details are available at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/spring/" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/spring/</a>.</p> <p><b><br>Earth Day Celebration<br>   Saturday, April 21 from 9:30 am – 5:00 pm<br>   Sunday, April 22 from 11:00 am – 5:00 pm</b><br> Celebrate conservation through art and music this Earth Day, with a weekend of festivities sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E). Help create a beautiful mural and spread awareness about the environment, watch artists and performers create nature-themed masterpieces before your eyes, enjoy live music from instruments made with recycled objects, and see live presentations about the wildlife we share our planet with. Then, take a load off in PG&amp;E's "pop-up café" filled with chairs, tables and benches made from recycled plastic, tennis balls and other found objects. Programs are free with admission unless otherwise noted. Highlights include:</p> <ul><li><b>Precita Eyes Mural Creation</b><br><i>11:30 – 2:30 in the Piazza </i><br>   Precita Eyes Mural Arts Center is a community-based arts organization that has played an integral role in the San Francisco's cultural heritage and arts education. On Earth Day weekend, Precita will lead a mural creation activity that will give visitors the chance to add their part to a large, nature-themed mural that we will all create together!</li>   <li><b>Shovelman</b><br><i>11:30 am– 12:30 pm and 2:30 – 3:30 pm on the Piazza Stage</i><br>   Shovelman is a junkyard beatnik—a shovel-guitar-wielding surrealist folk superhero. Armed with a collection of pawnshop effects pedals and an old barn-shovel turned slide-guitar, Shovelman plays ol’ fashioned folktronica—grooves looped straight out of the ground. The sound is like Mississippi delta blues being beamed from the electro-psychedelic future, colliding with the antiquated rubble of lyrical one-man-band hoboetry. He will entertain visitors while they take part in all the interactive art activities of the day.</li>   <li><b>Live Art by Mike Kershnar</b><br><i>11:00 am – 4:00 pm in the Piazza</i><br>   Mike Kershnar will create wildlife-themed art throughout the day. His colorful and dynamic artwork seeks to be a "signpost pointing the way toward Earth, to purpose, and to a more fully awakened state of being.” His style has been influenced by indigenous art styles from around the world, and his large mosaic paintings of North American wildlife provide a fresh perspective on the animals that inhabit the planet with us.</li>   <li><b>Richard and Judith Selby Lang</b><br><i>11:00 am and 2:00 pm at Science in Action</i><br>   Since 1999, Richard and Judith Selby Lang have been collecting plastic debris from a beach in Northern California and making beautiful art out of it. What began thirteen years ago as a simple "tidying up" job, has opened to a deep understanding of one tiny spot – the geology, flora &amp; fauna, and human history of just 1,000 yards of Kehoe Beach in Point Reyes National Seashore. It has opened their eyes to an ecological problem of global proportions, and has connected them to a world-wide community of fellow travelers working to bring attention to plastic pollution. They will share their story and their art with us and offer their unique perspective on this ongoing problem.</li>   <li><b>The Wildness and Spirit of Yellowstone</b><br><i>Saturday at 2:30pm at Science in Action</i><br>   Love grizzly bears, wolves, wildness and Yellowstone? Michael Leach, Director and Founder of Yellowstone Country Guardians, will recount his time as a bear education ranger in Yellowstone National Park and share the fascinating story of Yellowstone. Re-discover the beauty of living with wildness, and be inspired to re-commit to the future of Yellowstone and other wild spaces.</li>   <li><b>Fun &amp; Games with SPAWN</b><br><i>Piazza </i><br>   The Salmon Protection and Watershed Network works to protect endangered salmon in the Lagunitas Watershed in Marin County. They will host fun games for kids about the life cycle of salmon, and share stories about their work of habitat restoration and environmental education on one of the most endangered salmon creeks in central California.</li>   <li><b>Hands-on Family Activities</b><br><i>11am – 4pm in the Naturalist Center</i><br>   Visit the Academy's Naturalist Center for a variety of hands-on family-friendly activities all weekend long, including a trash timeline game, recycled craft activities, stories, and a special Earth Day assortment of books, games, DVDs and other resources about sustainability and our planet.</li>   <li><i><b>Fragile Planet </b></i><br><i>Planetarium</i><br>     Enjoy special screenings of the Academy's award-winning inaugural planetarium show, Fragile Planet, all weekend long. Leave Planet Earth behind as you fly to the farthest reaches of the Universe in this 25-minute show. Zoom through the roof of the Academy’s building, float up through Earth’s atmosphere, and gain an astronaut’s view of your home—the only planet currently known to support life. Then travel to the Moon, Mars, and even beyond the Milky Way to search for habitats that might support extraterrestrial life.</li> </ul><p><b><br>Nature Deficit Disorder, featuring Richard Louv, Co-founder of Children &amp; Nature Network <br>   Tuesday, April 24 at 8:00 pm</b><br><i>Herbst Theater, 401 Van Ness Avenue</i><br>   In his bestselling book <i>Last Child in the Woods</i>, Richard Louv sparked a national debate that spawned an international movement to reconnect kids and nature. In <i>The Nature Principle</i>, Mr. Louv delivers another powerful call to action—this time for adults. Supported by groundbreaking research, anecdotal evidence, and compelling personal stories, Louv identifies seven basic concepts that can help us reshape our lives. He makes a convincing case that we are entering the most creative period in history that, in fact, the twenty-first century will be the era of human restoration in the natural world. This encouraging and influential work offers renewed optimism while challenging us to rethink the way we live. In conversation with Dawn Scott, who serves as the family program coordinator at Spirit Rock. This event is part of the California Academy of Sciences' Conversations at the Herbst Theatre lecture series.<br><i>8pm; Tickets range from $20 -26. Purchase tickets in advance through City Box Office (<a href="http://www.cityboxoffice.com/" target="_blank">www.cityboxoffice.com</a>, or 415-392-4400). Lecture takes place at the Herbst Theater, 401 Van Ness Avenue, San Francisco. Full schedule available at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/herbst" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/herbst</a>.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Dirty, Earthy NightLife (ages 21+)<br>   Thursday, April 26 from 6-10 pm</b><br> Get your hands dirty this Earth Day with a NightLife devoted to compost, urban farming, recycled art, and getting in sync with nature. Experience a “dirt tasting” with artist Laura Parker, attend a “Worm Composting 101” workshop, and contemplate starting your own urban garden with the experts at Garden for the Environment. Catch a screening of KQED’s “Edible Insects” and consider joining the wave of gourmands getting their protein from delicacies like roasted mealworms and sautéed bee larvae. Award-winning conservation photographer Ian Shive returns to NightLife to showcase his stunning photos of the natural landscapes we’ve become detached from in this digital age, including a short multimedia film, Healing Waters, that profiles his latest photo expedition through India. Join SCRAP to create your own masterpiece from recycled and reused items, and catch special showings of Fragile Planet in the planetarium. Music by DJ Aaron Pope (a.k.a. the Academy’s green guru). <i>NightLife is for those ages 21 and over; a valid ID is required for entry. Admission is $12 per person ($10 Academy members).

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 13, 2012) – Bringing together the expertise of California’s oldest science institution and Northern California’s largest public broadcasting station, the California Academy of Sciences and KQED have developed a new multi-touch <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/earthquake/id552255768?mt=11" target="_blank">eBook</a> about earthquakes. A unique blend of education and technology wrapped in dynamic science and media resources from both institutions, the project represents the first collaboration between a science institution and a public broadcasting station to create original content  using Apple’s iBooks Author and iTunes U platform. <br>&nbsp;<br>   The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/course/earthquake/id552092722" target="_blank">iTunes U course</a> <i>Earthquake</i>, which works in conjunction with the eBook of the same name, launched simultaneously and, as of today, is the number-one course in iTunes U. Both the eBook and course are free to download from iTunes and coincide with the California Academy of Sciences’ new exhibit, “<a href="https://www.calacademy.org/academy/exhibits/earthquake/index.php?dc=" target="_blank">Earthquake: Life on a Dynamic Planet.</a>” The iTunes U course is designed for middle- and high-school science educators to broaden their own knowledge and to use with their students. The eBook serves as an interactive complement to the course and is also designed as a stand-alone book for life-long learners. Together, these two resources shed new light on what earthquakes are, and how they move continents, form our landscape, and fit into the larger story of plate tectonics.<br>&nbsp;<br> “Science education is more important than ever in the 21st century, and this project represents a major step forward in realizing the Academy’s vision for supporting teachers everywhere in their quest to amaze, inspire and inform their students,” says Elizabeth Babcock, dean of education at the California Academy of Sciences. “Digital platforms allow educators to tailor their own learning, and that of their students, in a way that simply wasn't possible even a few years ago. We are excited to collaborate with KQED to make such interactive resources freely available to educators and students beyond the Bay Area to improve the effectiveness of earth and life sciences teaching.” <br>&nbsp;<br> “We are delighted to partner with the California Academy of Sciences to leverage the latest technology to better serve our community and elevate the understanding of science,” says John Boland, president of KQED. “We are particularly excited about the potential for repurposing KQED’s rich and informative content in a visually engaging way using eBook technology, and this initial project leads the way. This is an important milestone in KQED’s long history of creating learning media and partnering with other nonprofit institutions to serve our community.”<br>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Earthquake </i>eBook and iTunes U Course&nbsp;</b><br>   The eBook has interactive chapters, videos and dynamic animations that bring seismic phenomena to life with the touch of a fingertip. The <i>Earthquake </i>iTunes U course is structured like an interactive class syllabus. Its educational activities and classroom-ready materials are woven into an educator’s primer on how plate tectonics shape the Earth's surface and directly impact people's lives. Several chapters from the eBook are referenced in the course, and clips from the Academy’s latest planetarium show, “Earthquake: Evidence of a Restless Planet,” are used in both the eBook and course. For Californians, sections on the science behind Bay Area earthquakes and how to prepare for and respond to them will be particularly poignant. <br>&nbsp;<br>   Both the eBook (40 pages) and iTunes U course are divided into five similar chapters: <br>&nbsp;<br> • <b>Earth’s Structure</b>, which discusses the core, mantel and crust of the Earth, plate boundaries and evidence of Earth’s different layers; <br> • <b>Plate Movements through Geologic Time</b>, which reviews how previous supercontinents formed then broke up, the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, and evidence of plate tectonics and how this process shaped human history; <br> • <b>Earthquake 101</b>, which covers fault types, determining an earthquake’s epicenter, measuring earthquakes and detailed information about seismic waves.<br> • <b>Bay Area Earthquakes</b>, which explores the Bay Area’s faults, the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and personal accounts of earthquakes; and <br> • <b>Get Prepared</b>, which reviews what do before, during and after an earthquake.<br>&nbsp;<br> An interactive quiz included in the eBook tests readers’ earthquake knowledge. The iTunes U course contains additional resources for teachers and students.<br>&nbsp;<br>   The <i>Earthquake </i>eBook can be viewed on an iPad with iBooks 2. Helena Carmena and Jaynée Howe of the Academy and Andrea Swensrud and Jenny Oh of KQED were the principal producers of the course and eBook. Non-iPad users can find all of KQED’s earthquake-related media online at <a href="http://www.kqed.org/quest" target="_blank">kqed.org/quest</a>. An Educator Guide to the Academy’s exhibit “Earthquake: Life on a Dynamic Planet,” is also available at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/teachers" target="_blank">calacademy.org/teachers</a>. <br>   &nbsp;<br>   KQED plans to produce several eBooks using Apple’s iBooks Author in the future and is currently working on one covering the San Joaquin and Sacramento River Delta. The California Academy of Sciences and KQED also look forward to possible future collaborations.<br>   &nbsp;<br>   The <i>Earthquake </i>eBook is available from the iBookstore on iPad or at <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/earthquake/id552255768?mt=11" target="_blank">itunes.apple.com/us/book/earthquake/id552255768?mt=11</a>.<br>   &nbsp;<br> The <i>Earthquake </i>iTunes U Course is available from iTunes U or at <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/course/earthquake/id552092722" target="_blank">itunes.apple.com/us/course/earthquake/id552092722</a>. <br> &nbsp;<br><b>About the California Academy of Sciences </b><br>   The California Academy of Sciences is a leading scientific and cultural institution based in San Francisco.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 23, 2012) – Prepare to be moved! <i>Earthquake: Life on a Dynamic Planet</i>, will open at the California Academy of Sciences on May 26, 2012, taking visitors on a kinetic journey toward understanding these super seismic phenomena and how they fit into the larger story of our ever-changing Earth.  Occupying the entire west hall of the Academy, the exhibit will feature a number of large-scale installations, including a walk-through model of the Earth, an enclosure for live baby ostriches (yes, there are surprising connections between earthquakes and ostriches!), an earthquake simulator resembling an old Victorian home, and an interactive space designed to teach earthquake preparedness. Concurrently, a new planetarium show will launch audiences on a breathtaking tour through space and time—flying over the San Andreas fault before diving into the planet’s interior, traveling back in time to witness both the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the break-up of Pangaea 200 million years ago, and much more.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>“San Francisco—and California too—are no strangers to the awesome power of earthquakes,” said Dr. Greg Farrington, Executive Director of the Academy.  “By showing visitors the science that underlies these natural events, we want to encourage preparedness and help visitors understand how the great movements of the continents have produced the landscape we call home today and the life around us.” <br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>EXHIBIT OVERVIEW</b><br> The 8,000-square-foot exhibit, titled <i>Earthquake: Life on a Dynamic Planet</i>, is located next to the Rainforest dome and continues the new Academy’s tradition of light-filled, airy exhibit spaces integrated with live animals and public programs.  The exhibit will run for several years.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <ul><li><b>Walk-through Earth</b><br>Entry into the <i>Earthquake </i>exhibit is through a dramatic, 25-foot-diameter model of the Earth.  Venturing through an oversized crack in the planet’s crust, visitors will find touchable geology specimens and interactive stations explaining the basics of plate tectonics.  Activity deep inside the planet drives the motion of tectonic plates on the Earth’s surface, resulting in the earthquakes we feel and the continental movements that happen more slowly—over millions of years.  <br>&nbsp;</li>  <li><b>How Land Shapes Life</b><br> The break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea roughly 200 million years ago resulted in two large landmasses: Laurasia (present-day northern continents) and Gondwana (present-day southern continents).  The second section of the <i>Earthquake</i> exhibit will focus on the diverse life forms that evolved and spread out across Gondwana, showing visitors that the same earth processes that cause destructive earthquakes in the human timescale can also provide constructive conditions for life in the geological timescale.<br>&nbsp;<br>Live ostriches, ancient fossils, plants, and mounted marsupials (mammals with pouches) will illustrate the shared legacy of India, Antarctica, Australia, South America, and Africa, which were once joined together.  For example, the iconic ostriches of Africa are large flightless birds whose closest relatives are scattered today in continents thousands of miles apart.  Yet they all evolved from a common ancestor, one that lived during a time when all the southern continents were connected.  Their distribution today is evidence that the Earth's landmasses have moved great distances in the past. To tell this story, the Academy is hatching out live ostrich chicks during <i>Earthquake</i>'s opening months. The chicks will be on view in the exhibit until December 2, 2012.<br>&nbsp;</li>  <li><b>Earthquake Simulator</b><br> Following a brief pre-show, visitors will enter an earthquake simulator designed to look like an old Victorian home in San Francisco.  Inside, simulated views of the downtown skyline and sounds of the World Series baseball game will transport guests back to 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989—the date and time of the infamous Loma Prieta earthquake.  A sudden tremor, lasting 15 seconds, will give visitors a sense of what this ground-jolting event felt like.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the experience doesn’t end there—the views of downtown will darken and change, and the sounds of the radio will give way to the clip-clop of a horse-drawn carriage.  For a second simulation, guests will travel farther back in time, to 5:12 am on April 18, 1906, the date of the most devastating earthquake in San Francisco’s history.  About 32 times stronger than Loma Prieta, this event brought the “Paris of America” to its knees, and the ensuing fire destroyed thousands of buildings, including the original Academy home on Market Street.<br>&nbsp;</li>  <li><b>Earthquake Preparedness</b><br> What should you do before, during, and after an earthquake?  The final section of the exhibit will address these questions through hands-on activities.  Visitors can identify crucial items for home preparedness kits (such as food, water, and hand-crank radios) and learn what to do after an earthquake (for example, checking for hazards and turning off the gas meter).  This section will also include a resource station offering additional preparedness advice from partner organizations.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b><br>  During the summer of 2012, Academy educators will shake things up with daily programs and hands-on demonstrations on the topics of geology, preparedness, and much more.  In addition, the Academy will hold an <b><i>Earthquake </i>Premiere Party</b> on the evening of May 25, 2012, featuring a 1906 period theme with dancing, music, and cocktails.  Visit <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/earthquake" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/earthquake</a> for details.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The <i>Earthquake </i>exhibit is generously supported by Ann L. and Charles B. Johnson, Lakeside Foundation, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, American Red Cross, Safeway, The Bernard Osher Foundation, and the California Earthquake Authority.<br>&nbsp;</p>

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 23, 2012) – Brace yourself for a seismic experience. <i>Earthquake: Evidence of a Restless Planet</i>, will open at the California Academy of Sciences on May 26, 2012, launching audiences on a breathtaking tour through space and time. During the show, audiences will fly over the San Andreas fault before diving into the planet’s interior, travel back in time to witness both the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the break-up of Pangaea 200 million years ago, and much more.  Concurrently, an 8,000-square-foot exhibit will debut in the west hall of the Academy, featuring large-scale installations such as a walk-through model of the Earth, an enclosure for live baby ostriches (yes, there are surprising connections between earthquakes and ostriches!), an earthquake simulator resembling an old Victorian home, and an interactive space designed to teach earthquake preparedness.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p><b>PLANETARIUM SHOW OVERVIEW</b><br> Following its first two award-winning productions, <i>Fragile Planet</i> and <i>Life: A Cosmic Story</i>, Morrison Planetarium will premiere <i>Earthquake: Evidence of a Restless Planet </i>on May 26.   The 30-minute show is narrated by Emmy-nominated actor and Bay Area native Benjamin Bratt.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>“Our all-digital planetarium has the ability to present complex topics—such as earth processes and the slow march of geological time—within a very visual, immersive environment,” said Ryan Wyatt, Director of Morrison Planetarium and Science Visualization.  “The new show harnesses the latest techniques in data-driven visualization to help visitors understand earth processes and think differently about living on our dynamic planet.”<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>Starting at Point Reyes in Northern California, the show flies south along the San Andreas Fault until it reaches San Francisco.  The Golden Gate Bridge fades away as the clock rewinds to 1906.  The audience experiences an all-digital recreation of the 7.9-magnitude earthquake, followed by a scientific dissection of the event—including views of the underground fault plane and the propagation of seismic energy waves based on supercomputer simulations.  Guests then embark on a high-speed tour of the past 200 million years, witnessing the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, flying over the cradle of humanity in Africa’s Great Rift Valley, and visiting sites of historic earthquakes in India, China, and Japan—including the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.  A planetarium presenter will bring audiences even more up-to-date during a live portion showcasing the latest seismic events happening around the planet—underscoring the fact that earthquakes big and small occur constantly.  The show ends with a look at the modern building strategies used by scientists and engineers for a safer and better prepared future.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Academy’s visualization studio, whose members have 180 years of collective experience in the TV and film industries, spent the past 17 months and processed 175 terabytes of digital information to make <i>Earthquake</i>.  The opening scene in 1906 San Francisco required painstaking research into historical photographs, insurance maps, and personal accounts to ensure that every detail, down to the names of stores on Market Street and the types of vessels sailing into San Francisco Bay, was as accurate as possible.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The production team also filmed on location at McClure’s Beach in Point Reyes, City Hall and the Ferry Building in San Francisco, and the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center in Richmond, California, for various scenes in the show.  High-resolution photography from these locations was grafted onto three-dimensional frameworks built in computer software, resulting in highly immersive environments when projected onto the planetarium’s 75-foot-diameter screen.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>With a basis in real data, the show draws heavily from the expertise of key scientific partners.  For example, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) provided accurate ground motion visualizations for the 1906 earthquake, ground motions for a hypothetical earthquake on the Hayward Fault, visualizations of seismic waves traveling through the Earth, and a temperature map of Earth’s interior based on scientific evidence.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>“The LLNL team is happy to have contributed simulation data to the show and thrilled to see the results in such a stunning visual form,” said Dr. Arthur Rodgers, a seismologist at LLNL.  “It’s also satisfying to know that many people might learn something they didn’t know about earthquakes or plate tectonics through work done at LLNL.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In addition, the U.S. Geological Survey provided detailed topographic and geologic information for California state and data for the 1906 earthquake.  Planetarium presenters will use Microsoft Research WorldWide Telescope, an interactive tool for visualizing earth and sky, to show real-time earthquakes around the world during the live portion of the show.  And NOAA contributed a dramatic simulation of the March 2011 tsunami moving across the Pacific.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The <i>Earthquake </i>planetarium show will play several times daily during 2012-2013.  A video trailer is available at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/earthquake" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/earthquake</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The production was generously underwritten by Ann L. and Charles B. Johnson, in tribute to former California Academy of Sciences President and Fellow Bruce A. Bolt for his contributions to seismology and public safety.<br>&nbsp;</p>

			<div id="pr_body">  <p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 26, 2012) - The California Academy of Sciences and the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science in collaboration have launched their first Google Earth-based film and interactive tour, “A Global Water Story.” Leveraging technology from Google Earth, the film plunges users into water issues relevant at global and regional scale in the American Southwest and beyond. <br>   &nbsp;<br> Access to freshwater is taken for granted by many people in developed countries, but dwindling resources, growing populations, and an increasingly variable climate threaten freshwater availability around the world. For the first time, a Google Earth-based film and tour will bring together information about global environmental processes that affect freshwater supplies, including geography and climate, and will reveal how humans have adapted these natural systems to thrive in unlikely places. Utilizing the power of Google Earth, the film takes viewers from the Himalayas and the Middle East to the arid southwest of North America, exploring freshwater systems in detail—as well as the innovative solutions people have developed to make the most of available resources. An associated interactive tour encourages users to explore the story at their own pace by clicking on an interactive map. Informational pop-up windows about water conservation projects around the world, as well as those close to home, will inspire users to learn about how they can take action. <br>&nbsp;<br> “A Global Water Story” originally premiered as a live presentation at the Gates Planetarium at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science in May 2011 as part of the Worldviews Network, a three-year environmental literacy project funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). With a grant from Google Earth Outreach, the Worldviews Network production teams at the California Academy of Sciences and Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science joined with German media agency Visuamundo to translate the planetarium story to the Google Earth platform.<br>&nbsp;<br> Users can download the eight-minute film for free by visiting the <a href="http://worldviews.net/a-global-water-story/">Worldviews Network website</a> or take a deeper look at the issues by downloading the interactive tour to explore the story on their own in Google Earth.<br></p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 9, 2012) – Groupers, a family of fishes often found in coral reefs and prized for their quality of flesh, are facing critical threats to their survival.  As part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission, a team of scientists has spent the past ten years assessing the status of 163 grouper species worldwide.  They report that 20 species (12%) are at risk of extinction if current overfishing trends continue, and an additional 22 species (13%) are Near Threatened.  These findings were published online on April 28 in the journal <i>Fish and Fisheries</i>.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>“Fish are one of the last animal resources commercially harvested from the wild by humans, and groupers are among the most desirable fishes,” said Dr. Luiz Rocha, Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, and one of the paper’s authors.  “Unfortunately, the false perception that marine resources are infinite is still common in our society, and in order to preserve groupers and other marine resources we need to reverse this old mentality.”<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>The team estimates that at least 90,000,000 groupers were captured in 2009.  This represents more than 275,000 metric tonnes of fish, an increase of 25% from 1999, and 1600% greater than 1950 figures.  The Caribbean Sea, coastal Brazil, and Southeast Asia are home to a disproportionately high number of the 20 Threatened grouper species.  (A species is considered “Threatened” if it is Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable under IUCN criteria.)<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Groupers are among the highest priced market reef species (estimated to be a multi-billion dollar per year industry), are highly regarded for the quality of their flesh, and are often among the first reef fishes to be overexploited.  Their disappearance from coral reefs could upset the ecological balance of these threatened ecosystems, since they are ubiquitous predators and may play a large role in controlling the abundance of animals farther down the food chain.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Unfortunately, groupers take many years (typically 5-10) to become sexually mature, making them vulnerable for a relatively long time before they can reproduce and replenish their populations.  In addition, fisheries have exploited their natural behavior of gathering in great numbers during the breeding season.  The scientists also conclude that grouper farming (mariculture) has not mitigated overfishing in the wild.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Although the prognosis is poor for the restoration and successful conservation of Threatened grouper species, the authors do recommend some courses of action, including optimizing the size and location of Marine Protected Areas, minimum size limits for individual fish, quotas on the amount of catch, limits on the number of fishers, and seasonal protection during the breeding season.  However, the scientists stress that “community awareness and acceptance, and effective enforcement are paramount” for successful implementation, as well as “action at the consumer end of the supply chain by empowering customers to make better seafood choices.”<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>These findings are posted online at: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00455.x" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00455.x</a><br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Download Images:</b><br><b>1)</b> The critically endangered Atlantic goliath grouper, <i>Epinephelus itajara</i>, from the subtropical and tropical Atlantic (photo: Athila Bertoncini): <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/docs/press/itajara.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.calacademy.org/docs/press/itajara.jpg</a><br><b>2)</b> The orange-spotted grouper, <i>Epinephelus coioides</i>, from the Indo-Pacific is categorized as Near Threatened (photo: Luiz Rocha): <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/docs/press/coioides.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.calacademy.org/docs/press/coioides.jpg</a><br>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things.

The two-day event will provide local youth the opportunity to engage in digital learning and interactive education with the guidance of Bay Area community and media arts organizations, including Children’s Creativity Museum, TILT, Sunset Neighborhood Beacon Center, World Savvy, WritersCorps and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Awarded $100,000 in grant funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the four partner organizations are working toward the ultimate goal of developing a Learning Lab at the San Francisco Main Library, where youth can actively engage in and develop digital media skills that they can build upon and transform into valuable learning tools for life and education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The MacArthur Foundation has already supported the creation of successful Hive Learning Networks in New York and Chicago, which are dedicated to transforming the learning landscape and creating opportunities for youth. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>"While the Bay Area is a hub for technology and innovation, there are thousands of young people in San Francisco who do not have access to digital tools, nor the chance to learn skills that will be critical to thrive in the 21st century; to participate meaningfully in their world and to write their own story,” said Jill Bourne, Deputy City Librarian for the San Francisco Public Library. “The Library is thrilled to be working with our partners to create these opportunities." The San Francisco Learning Lab partners and participating organizations will provide two days of hands-on digital learning, creative collaboration and interactive lessons to develop questions and solve problems around the theme of “Save the Earth.” </p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The event will be held at the new Ortega branch of the San Francisco Public Library (3223 Ortega Street). On Friday, October 26 from 1:00-4:00 pm, local middle and high schools are encouraged to participate during school hours. On Saturday, October 27 from 1:00-5:00 pm, the event is open to teens and the general public. This is a free event.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (October 3, 2012) – Morrison Planetarium will celebrate its 60th anniversary with a week of special programs at the California Academy of Sciences.  From November 5-9, visitors can enjoy a “quadruple feature” of the planetarium’s all-digital, fulldome shows, see rarely displayed artwork and photographs from the Morrison’s history, and step back in time with special screenings of <i>Science in Action</i>, an educational TV series produced by the Academy from 1950-1966.  In addition, adults can attend two evening programs: a lecture on November 5 describing the history of planetariums, and NightLife on November 8 featuring cocktails, music, and show screenings.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The original planetarium opened on November 8, 1952, with a gift from the estate of May T. Morrison, widow of Alexander Francis Morrison, a prominent San Francisco attorney for whom the planetarium is named.  It made history as the first planetarium in the United States to feature a homemade star projector.  On September 27, 2008, a new Morrison Planetarium opened as part of the completely rebuilt California Academy of Sciences, once again making history—this time as the world’s largest all-digital planetarium.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>See below for a list of anniversary programs and a brief history of the planetarium.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <div align="center">&nbsp;<br><b>ANNIVERSARY PROGRAMS</b><br>&nbsp;</div>  <p><b>PLANETARIUM SHOWS<br> November 5-9 from 11:30 am - 4:30 pm</b><br> For the first time since its reopening, Morrison Planetarium will play all four shows in its repertory throughout the day.<br><i>Free with Academy admission.

How did they come to be, and how have their approaches to science education and entertainment evolved during that time? As a science historian, Dr. Jordan D. Marché II of the University of Wisconsin will describe the major threads in planetarium history, including how the Morrison hosted the first planetarium light shows in the late 1950s. More than an account of evolving projection technologies, his talk will examine how the community of planetarium educators organized in response to broader social changes, including the dawning space age. <i>$12 adults, $10 seniors, $6 Academy members. Purchase tickets in advance at www.calacademy.org/event_tickets or call (415) 379-8000. Seating is limited.</i><br>&nbsp;</p>   <p><b>NIGHTLIFE (AGES 21+)<br>  Thursday, November 8 from 6:00 - 10:00 pm</b><br> Every Thursday night, music, creatures, and cocktails come together for NightLife at the Academy.

Prior to that time, the Carl Zeiss company of Germany had created virtually every star projector in use. But in the aftermath of World War II, their factory lay in ruins, and there were no plans to revive their star projector business. Faced with this problem, yet determined to have a planetarium, Academy Director Robert Miller declared at a board meeting, “We will build a projector.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Academy achieved its goal by relying on the expertise of one of its paleontologists, Dr. G Dallas Hanna, who had an interest in optics. Using a simple brochure about a Zeiss projector as his guide, Dr. Hanna worked with the Academy’s machine shop to create the projector. The shop had acquired optics expertise during World War II, when it had been converted to military use.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Previously, star projectors made use of metal sheets drilled with tiny holes; light projected through the holes became stars on a planetarium dome. However, the resulting stars were too perfectly round and did not create a realistic starfield. The Academy projector made use of a different technique: using microscopes, an Academy staffer placed carborundum crystals onto glass lenses and then coated the lenses with vaporized aluminum. Positioning the crystals alone took six months to complete! When the crystals were carefully brushed away, they left a series of tiny holes that closely corresponded to the position of 3,800 different stars, and light projected through these irregularly-shaped holes resulted in a more naturalistic starfield. The completed star projector weighed some 5,000 pounds, stretched 13 feet in length, included 141 optical systems made up of 321 lenses, and contained 25,000 individual parts controlled by over four miles of wire.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The opening of the planetarium, with its American-made projector, made national news, coming at a time of growing interest in space exploration, but before NASA launches were common or man had walked on the Moon. Planetariums were so novel in 1952 that some early audience members would call the box office prior to their visit to ask if the evening’s show would be cancelled due to fog. They soon learned that the weather was always good for star-gazing inside the planetarium.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>Fifty-six years later, on September 27, 2008, a new Morrison Planetarium opened as part of the completely rebuilt California Academy of Sciences. Housed in a 90-foot-diameter dome, the new planetarium once again employed the latest technologies to create immersive experiences for its visitors.  It is currently the largest all-digital planetarium in the world. In addition, the 75-foot-diameter aluminum screen matches the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles as the largest planetarium screen in North America. Inside the dome, digital projectors and software, driven in part by advances in the video game industry, allow the planetarium to produce the most accurate and interactive digital Universe ever created, giving visitors the opportunity to tour the cosmos, “fly” to other planets, or even embark on adventures focusing on biology and Earth sciences.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Our efforts redefine how science visualization integrates into planetarium programming,” said Ryan Wyatt, Director of Morrison Planetarium and Science Visualization.  “Today’s technology allows us to convey scientific concepts with unprecedented fidelity, using actual research data as the foundation of our storytelling.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Properly lit, the dome seems infinite to the entering visitor, creating a uniquely immersive experience and an accurate re-creation of many virtual environments—from Golden Gate Park to the Orion Nebula, 1,500 light-years away. Audience members view a show that fills their field of view and moves at a rate of 30 images per second, which visually approximates an alternate reality—corresponding not to a film, but to an experience inside an environment.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Since 2008, the Academy’s Visualization Studio has produced three fulldome shows for the planetarium: <i>Fragile Planet</i>, <i>Life: A Cosmic Story</i>, and <i>Earthquake: Evidence of a Restless Planet</i>.  The flexibility of the new Morrison’s technologies has allowed it to host a variety of special events as well, such as musical performances, film screenings, and immersive lectures.<br>&nbsp;</p>

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 6, 2012) – In 2012, researchers at the California Academy of Sciences added 189 new relatives to our family tree, enriching our understanding of the complex web of life on Earth and strengthening our ability to make informed conservation decisions. The new species include 135 arthropods, 41 fishes, seven plants, four sea slugs, one reptile, and one amphibian.  They were described by more than a dozen Academy scientists along with several dozen international collaborators.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Proving that there are still plenty of places to explore and things to discover on Earth, the scientists made their finds over four continents and two oceans, ventured into remote caves and  descended to the bottom of the sea, looked in their owns backyards (California) and on the other side of the world (China).  Their results, published in 32 different scientific papers, help advance the Academy’s research into two of the most important scientific questions of our time: <i>"How did life evolve?"</i> and <i>"How will it persist?"</i><br> &nbsp;</p>  <p>"The ongoing discovery of new species is an important function of systematics-based institutions like the California Academy of Sciences," said Dr. Terry Gosliner, Dean of Science and Research Collections at the Academy.  “During these times, when we are facing the planet’s sixth mass extinction, species may be disappearing before we have a chance to find and describe them.  How can we know what to protect, if we don’t know that it exists in the first place?”<br> &nbsp;</p>  <p>Below are a few highlights among the 189 species described by the Academy this year.  For a full list of species, including geographic information, visit <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2012/new_species_list.php" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2012/new_species_list.php</a>.<br> &nbsp;</p>  <p><b>A New Family of Spiders—with Claws</b><br> The forests of the Pacific Northwest are renowned for their unique and ancient animals and plants, such as coast redwoods, tailed frogs, mountain beavers—and now, a large, newly discovered spider. <i> Trogloraptor </i>(or “cave robber”) is named for its cave home and spectacular, elongate claws.  It is a spider so evolutionarily special that it represents not only a new genus and species, but also a new family (Trogloraptoridae).  Even for the species-rich insects and arachnids, to discover a new, previously unknown family is rare—it's been more than 100 years since the description of an entirely new spider family from North America.<br> &nbsp;</p>    <p><i>Trogloraptor </i>hangs beneath rudimentary webs beneath cave ceilings.  It is about four centimeters wide when its legs are extended—larger than the size of a half-dollar coin. Its extraordinary, raptorial claws suggest that it is a fierce, specialized predator, but its prey and attack behavior remain unknown.<br> &nbsp;</p>  <p>A team of citizen scientists and arachnologists found these spiders living in caves in southwest Oregon.<br> &nbsp;</p>  <p><i>Trogloraptor</i> was not the only new cave spider described in 2012: in another study involving spelunking, Academy scientists and their colleagues described ten new spider species (<i>Tayshaneta </i>spp.) living in central Texas caves.<br> &nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Out of Africa</b><br> The islands of Sao Tome and Principe, located in the Gulf of Guinea off Africa’s west coast, host a number of plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians found nowhere else on Earth.  Since 2001, the Academy has embarked on several multidisciplinary expeditions to the islands in an effort to document their biodiversity and raise conservation awareness.  A new species of gecko found only on Principe, <i>Hemidactylus principensis</i>, was described this year by Academy scientist Bob Drewes and his colleagues.  For a long time, it was considered the same species as <i>Hemidactylus greeffi</i> from Sao Tome, but morphological and molecular work has resolved them as two distinct species, endemic to their respective islands. "This gecko is just one more example of the amazing degree of endemism on Sao Tome and Principe," said Drewes. "Habitat destruction is a growing threat to the species on these islands, and we want to make sure the nation's residents know what they have to lose before they make decisions that will impact their rich biological resources."<br> &nbsp;</p>      <p>On the other side of Africa, a frog collected in 1930 and deposited in a museum collection finally received recognition as a new species.  <i>Arthroleptis kutogundua</i> was described by Academy scientist David Blackburn from a single specimen collected from the Ngozi volcanic crater in southwest Tanzania.  It is unknown whether the species still exists in this remote region.<br> &nbsp;</p>    <p><b>The Jaguar Shark Lives...</b><br> The California Academy of Sciences sent its first scientific expedition to the Galapagos Islands in 1905 and has since organized dozens of return trips. As a result, the Academy is now home to the world's most comprehensive collection of scientific specimens from these famous islands. In 2012, Academy scientists and colleagues described a new species of Galapagos catshark (<i>Bythaelurus giddingsi</i>) collected from depths of 1,400 - 1,900 feet via submersible.  It is approximately a foot long and has a chocolate-brown coloration with pale, irregularly distributed spots on its body. The authors chose "jaguar catshark" as the common name for the new species, partly because of its spotted pattern, and partly because it bears a striking resemblance to the mythical "Jaguar Shark" seen cruising the dark depths in <i>The Life Aquatic</i>, the Wes Anderson film for which the authors have a particular fondness.<br> &nbsp;</p>    <p><b>A Bounty of Reef Fishes</b><br>June marked the debut of <i>Reef Fishes of the East Indies</i>, a magnum opus that was several decades in the making. Co-authored by Academy research associate Mark Erdmann, this three-volume book set provides descriptions and color photographs of more than 2,500 reef fishes, including 25 new species. Its geographic coverage spans the South China Sea, Andaman Sea, and the Coral Triangle—the region between the Philippines, Borneo, and New Guinea that is regarded as a global center of biodiversity.  With these books, the authors hope to inspire appreciation for the area’s marine fauna and help guide governmental efforts for conservation.<br> &nbsp;</p> <p><i>***Note: This press release was revised after its initial publication to update the total new species count to 189.***</i><br> &nbsp;</p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (April 18, 2012) – As the two-year anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico approaches, a team of scientists led by Dr. Peter Roopnarine of the California Academy of Sciences has detected evidence that pollutants from the oil have entered the ecosystem’s food chain. For the past two years, the team has been studying oysters (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>) collected both before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil reached the coasts of Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida. These animals can incorporate heavy metals and other contaminants from crude oil into their shells and tissue, allowing Roopnarine and his colleagues to measure the impact of the spill on an important food source for both humans and a wide variety of marine predators. The team’s preliminary results demonstrate that oysters collected post-spill contain higher concentrations of heavy metals in their shells, gills, and muscle tissue than those collected before the spill. In much the same way that mercury becomes concentrated in large, predatory fish, these harmful compounds may get passed on to the many organisms that feed on the Gulf’s oysters.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>“While there is still much to be done as we work to evaluate the impact of the Deepwater Horizon spill on the Gulf’s marine food web, our preliminary results suggest that heavy metals from the spill have impacted one of the region’s most iconic primary consumers and may affect the food chain as a whole,” says Roopnarine, Curator of Geology at the California Academy of Sciences.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>The research team collected oysters from the coasts of Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida on three separate occasions after the Deepwater Horizon oil had reached land: August 2010, December 2010, and May 2011.  For controls, they also examined specimens collected from the same localities in May 2010, prior to the landfall of oil; historic specimens collected from the Gulf in 1947 and 1970; and a geographically distant specimen collected from North Carolina in August 2010.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Oysters continually build their shells, and if contaminants are present in their environment, they can incorporate those compounds into their shells. Roopnarine first discovered that he could study the growth rings in mollusk shells to evaluate the damage caused by oil spills and other pollutants five years ago, when he started surveying the shellfish of San Francisco Bay. His work in California revealed that mollusks from more polluted areas, like the waters around Candlestick Park, had incorporated several heavy metals that are common in crude oil into their shells.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>To determine whether or not the Gulf Coast oysters were incorporating heavy metals from the Deepwater Horizon spill into their shells in the same manner, Roopnarine and his colleagues used a method called “laser ablation ICP-MS,” or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  First, a laser vaporizes a small bit of shell at different intervals along the shell’s growth rings. Then the vaporized sample is superheated in plasma, and transferred into a machine that can identify and quantify the various elements in the sample by mass. Roopnarine and his colleagues measured higher concentrations of three heavy metals common in crude oil—vanadium, cobalt, and chromium—in the post-spill specimens they examined compared to the controls, and this difference was found to be statistically significant.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>In a second analysis, the scientists used ICP-MS to analyze gill and muscle tissue in both pre-spill and post-spill specimens.  They found higher concentrations of vanadium, cobalt, and lead in the post-spill specimens, again with statistical significance.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>In a final analysis, the team examined oyster gill tissue under the microscope and found evidence of “metaplasia,” or transformation of tissues in response to a disturbance, in 89 percent of the post-spill specimens.  Cells that were normally columnar (standing up straight) had become stratified (flattened)—a known sign of physical or chemical stress in oysters.  Stratified cells have much less surface area available for filter feeding and gas exchange, which are the primary functions of oyster gills. Oysters suffering from this type of metaplasia will likely have trouble reproducing, which will lead to lower population sizes and less available food for oyster predators.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>The team presented their data at a poster session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in December 2011, and is preparing their preliminary findings for publication.  However, their work is just beginning.  In addition to increasing the number of pre- and post-spill oyster specimens in their analysis, the team also plans to repeat their analyses using another bivalve species, the marsh mussel (<i>Geukensia demissa</i>).  Roopnarine is also planning to create a mathematical model linking the oyster and mussel to other commercially important species, such as mackerel and crabs, to demonstrate the potential impact of the oil spill on the Gulf food web.  Scientists don’t currently know how these types of trace metals move through the food web, how long they persist, or how they impact the health of higher-level consumers, including humans—but the construction of a data-driven computer model will provide the framework for tackling these important questions.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Roopnarine and his colleagues have faced a number of challenges during the course of their study.  Unfortunately, pure crude oil samples from Deepwater Horizon have remained inaccessible, making it impossible for the team to compare the heavy metal ratios they have documented in the oysters to the ratios found in the Deepwater Horizon oil.  Additionally, the chemical compositions of artificial dispersants and freshwater that were intentionally spread in the Gulf to alleviate the spill are also unknown—additional variables that could affect the team’s research. The team is hopeful that they will eventually be able to analyze these samples, thus shedding more light on their results.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Historical specimens for this study were provided by museum collections at the California Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.  Collaborators on this project are Deanne Roopnarine from Nova Southeastern University, Florida; David Gillikin from Union College, New York; Laurie Anderson from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology; and David Goodwin from Denison University, Ohio.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific education and research and is at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the diversity of Earth’s living things.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (July 31, 2012) – Today, aquarium biologists introduced six striped pyjama sharks to the popular African penguin exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park. The sharks and penguins are expected to <br>cohabitate peacefully as they are natural neighbors, both occupying niche areas in their native habitat off of the South African coast. The pyjama sharks, docile and mild-mannered, are nocturnal and will likely spend most of their time in the crevices and caves built for them by Academy biologists, posing no threat to the energetic penguins.<br><br>Born at an aquarium in Lisbon, Portugal, the sharks were acquired by Steinhart Aquarium several months ago in an effort to enhance the exhibit by showcasing two species that rarely live together in captivity. Since their arrival, Academy biologists have implemented a formal training plan to regulate their feeding habits. The goal of this plan is to attract the <br>sharks, typically nocturnal bottom feeders, closer to the surface for feeding and monitoring, <br>allowing biologists to keep a watchful eye on their progress.<br><br>Named for its appearance, the pyjama shark is identified typically by its body pattern of long, dark stripes, and prominent but short nasal barbells. Upon hatching, pyjama sharks generally measure between 14-15 centimeters and can grow up to 100 centimeters as adults. The Academy’s pyjama sharks, four female and two male, arrived at a length of 40 centimeters and continue to grow.  </p>

			<div id="pr_header"><b>LUCY AND SELAM'S SPECIES CLIMBED TREES</b><p><i>The most comprehensive analysis to date of</i> Australopithecus afarensis<br><i>shoulder blades indicates a partially arboreal lifestyle</i></p>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (October 25, 2012) — <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> (the species of the well-known "Lucy" skeleton) was an upright walking species, but the question of whether it also spent much of its time in trees has been the subject of much debate, partly because a complete set of <i>A. afarensis</i> shoulder blades has never before been available for study. For the first time, Midwestern University Professor David Green and Curator of Anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences, Zeresenay Alemseged, have thoroughly examined the two complete shoulder blades of the fossil "Selam," an exceptionally well-preserved skeleton of an <i>A. afarensis</i> child from Dikika, Ethiopia, discovered in 2000 by Dr. Alemseged. Further preparation and extensive analyses of these rare bones showed them to be quite apelike, suggesting that this species was adapted to climbing trees in addition to walking bipedally when on the ground. "The question as to whether <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> was strictly bipedal or if they also climbed trees has been intensely debated for more than thirty years," said Dr. Green. "These remarkable fossils provide strong evidence that these individuals were still climbing at this stage in human evolution." The new findings are published in the October&nbsp;26 issue of the journal <i>Science</i>.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>Dr. Alemseged, assisted by Kenyan lab technician Christopher Kiarie, spent 11 years carefully extracting the two shoulder blades from the rest of the skeleton, which was encased in a sandstone block. "Because shoulder blades are paper-thin, they rarely fossilize—and when they do, they are almost always fragmentary," said Dr. Alemseged. "So finding both shoulder blades completely intact and attached to a skeleton of a known and pivotal species was like hitting the jackpot. This study moves us a step closer toward answering the question 'When did our ancestors abandon climbing behavior?' It appears that this happened much later than many researchers have previously suggested."<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>Selam was a three-year-old <i>A. afarensis</i> girl who lived about 3.3 million years ago, and she represents the most complete skeleton of her kind to date. After freeing the shoulder blades from the surrounding rock, Green and Alemseged digitized them using a Microscribe, and then took detailed measurements to characterize their shape and function, comparing them to the rare shoulder fossils of other early human relatives: <i>Homo ergaster </i>("Turkana Boy"), <i>Homo floresiensis</i> ("The Hobbit"), <i>A. africanus</i>, and two adult specimens of <i>A. afarensis</i>. They also made comparisons with an extensive modern sample of juvenile and adult chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and human specimens.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>The analysis of the shape and function of the bones revealed that <i>A. afarensis</i> shoulder blades are apelike, indicating a partially arboreal lifestyle. Drs. Green and Alemseged also found that, like living apes, the shoulder anatomy of juvenile and adult representatives of <i>A. afarensis</i> were quite similar. "Human scapulae change shape throughout ontogeny in a significantly different manner than closely related apes," said Dr. Green. "When we compared Selam's scapula with adult members of <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>, it was clear that the pattern of growth was more consistent with that of apes than humans." At the same time, most researchers agree that many traits of the <i>A. afarensis</i> hip bone, lower limb, and foot are unequivocally humanlike and adapted for upright walking. "This new find confirms the pivotal place that Lucy and Selam's species occupies in human evolution," said Dr. Alemseged. "While bipedal like humans, <i>A. afarensis</i> was still a capable climber. Though not fully human, <i>A. afarensis</i> was clearly on its way."<br>&nbsp;</p> <div align="center" style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: 12pt">****</div>  <p><b>David J.

Tickets are available at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/events/sleepovers/">www.calacademy.org/events/sleepovers/</a>. <br><br><b>Penguins + Pajamas Sleepovers (ages 5+)</b>: February 11, April 21, May 19, June 16, July 20, October 12, November 10, December 30 (6:30pm start time), 2012  <br><b>Penguins + Pajamas Sleepover for Grownups (ages 21+)</b>: September 21, 2012 <i><br>Check www.calacademy.org/events/sleepovers/ for details and availability. </i><br><br>Doors will open at 6:00 pm, when sleepover guests are invited to come in and explore the Academy after it’s closed to the public. Participants can take in the evening songs of the rainforest birds, sing "twinkle twinkle" to a sea star at the Discovery Tidepool, and watch the fish cruise under the moonlight in the Philippine Coral Reef tank. Then, guests can catch a special penguin talk, and become stargazing gurus during an after-hours planetarium show.<br><br>Before bedtime, sleepover guests can grab a snack of cookies and milk and settle in for story time, featuring "Pierre the Penguin," the true story of the Academy’s famous wetsuit-wearing penguin. When the lights go out, participants can unroll their sleeping bags in African Hall, next to the swaying kelp of the California Coast tank, or even at the Swamp window, face-to-face with Claude, the albino alligator. In the morning, it’s time to rise and shine, then head over to the Academy Café for breakfast before the sleepover event ends at 8:00 am. <br><br>The "Penguins and Pajamas" Academy sleepover package includes overnight parking in the Music Concourse parking garage as well as next-day museum admission, breakfast, snacks, and a special commemorative gift.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 17, 2012) – A team of scientists and cave conservationists discovered a relatively huge, unique spider in caves and forests of the Pacific Northwest.  The novel combination of evolutionary features in this spider, <i>Trogloraptor</i>, compelled them to recognize a new family.  A study of the new family and its evolutionary and conservation significance was published in the open access journal <i>ZooKeys </i>on August 17.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The forests of the coastal regions from California to British Columbia are renowned for their unique and ancient animals and plants, such as coast redwoods, tailed frogs, mountain beavers—and now, a large, newly discovered spider. <i> Trogloraptor </i>(or "cave robber") is named for its cave home and spectacular, elongate claws.  It is a spider so evolutionarily special that it represents not only a new genus and species, but also a new family (Trogloraptoridae).  Even for the species-rich insects and arachnids, to discover a new, previously unknown family is rare.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>A team of citizen scientists from the Western Cave Conservancy and arachnologists from the California Academy of Sciences found these spiders living in caves in southwest Oregon.  Colleagues from San Diego State University found more in old-growth redwood forests.  Charles Griswold, Curator of Arachnology, Joel Ledford, postdoctoral researcher, and Tracy Audisio, graduate student, all at the California Academy of Sciences, collected, analyzed, and described the new family.  Audisio's participation was supported by the Harriet Exline Frizzell Memorial Fund and by the Summer Systematics Institute at the Academy, which is funded by the National Science Foundation.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><i>Trogloraptor </i>hangs beneath rudimentary webs beneath cave ceilings.  It is about four centimeters wide when its legs are extended—larger than the size of a half-dollar coin.  Their extraordinary, raptorial claws suggest that they are fierce, specialized predators, but their prey and attack behavior remain unknown.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The anatomy of <i>Trogloraptor </i>forces arachnologists to revise their understanding of spider evolution.  Strong evidence suggests that <i>Trogloraptor </i>is a close relative of goblin spiders (Oonopidae), but <i>Trogloraptor </i>possesses a mosaic of ancient, widespread features and evolutionary novelties.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>The true distribution of <i>Trogloraptor </i>remains unknown: that such a relatively large, peculiar animal could elude discovery until 2012 suggests that more may be lurking in the forests and caves of western North America.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p><i>These findings were published in: Griswold C, Audisio T, Ledford J.  2012.  An extraordinary new family of spiders from caves in the Pacific Northwest (Araneae, Trogloraptoridae, new family). </i> ZooKeys <i>215: 77-102. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.215.3547" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.215.3547</a></i><br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>About the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Academy is an international center for scientific exploration and education and is at the forefront of efforts to understand two of the most important topics of our time: life and its sustainability.

The big bang is the scientific story of creation and it’s supported by a web of evidence pointing to an extremely hot and dense early state for the universe. What if we could look into space and see not only our place in the universe but also how we came to be here? As it happens, we can. Because it takes time for light to travel, we see more and more distant regions of the universe as they were in the successively greater past. Dr. Impey uses this concept—"look-back time"—to take us on an intergalactic tour that is simultaneously out in space and back in time. Performing a type of cosmic archaeology, Dr. Impey describes the astronomical clues that scientists have used to solve fascinating mysteries about the origins and development of our universe. <i>How It All Began</i> book signing to follow.  <i>7:30 pm; Purchase tickets in advance online at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/lectures">www.calacademy.org/lectures</a>, or by calling (415) 379-8000.

The Master Birder program will be taught by experts in ornithology with the objective to develop 20 new master-level birders who will acquire enhanced conservation skills and become active volunteers for GGAS or the Academy. This series of classes will take place over the course of the year with 10 classroom sessions held on the first Wednesday of each month and 10 field excursions on the following weekend. Upon completion of the program, the graduate will have developed a field notebook documenting sightings of over 200 bird species, know how to identify the more difficult bird species, and have an understanding of habitats and bird communities, bird physiology, behavior and taxonomy. Many of the classes will take place at the Academy, allowing instructors to utilize the Academy’s extensive collections to support class instruction. Select classes may take place at other local institutions.  <i>This course is $600 for adults, $500 for Academy and Golden Gate Audubon Society members. </i><i>For more information and prerequisites, visit  <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/lectures">www.calacademy.org/lectures</a>, or call (415) 379-5378.</i></p>    <p><br><b>CONSERVATION PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOP: <br><i> The Digital Darkroom for the Nature Photographer  </i> <br> Sunday, February 10 from 1:00 – 4:00 pm </b><br><i>Led by Gary Sharlow, Photographer and Academy Education Manager  </i><br>This workshop is designed as an introduction to the digital darkroom and will cover a tour of Adobe Lightroom 4 and the Nik Software plug-in suite.

When the Lucy skeleton was discovered in 1974, it helped establish that this creature was an upright walking species, pushing the then accepted date for bipedalism by a million years. Lucy’s foot, knee and pelvis are all very human-like. However, the upper body told a different story, with features that were much more ape-like, including long arms and curved fingers. At the time, scientists split into two groups. One group argued, Yes, A. afarensis has ape-like features, but the species didn’t need them for survival, it’s just ancestral retention or evolutionary baggage. The second group interpreted the ape-like characteristics for their function: they saw the lower body for bipedalism and the upper body for climbing. This discussion went on for the following 35 years. In this presentation, Dr. Alemseged discusses the evidence for climbing behavior in A. afarensis based on new evidence from his own find “Selam,” currently the most complete and earliest skeleton of a juvenile human ancestor. <i>7:00 pm; Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for seniors, free for Academy members.

Professor Matt Walker of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory within the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley and his team have found compelling evidence for the purpose of this kind of sleep, suggesting that it can solidify newly learned memories by rewiring the architecture of the brain. Bursts of electrical impulse brain waves known as sleep spindles may be networking between the brain's hippocampus (with its limited storage capacity) and the prefrontal cortex's (the storage area), effectively clearing the way for new learning. His team has also found evidence that sleep can associate and integrate new memories together, performing a kind of sleep-dependent alchemy. Beyond learning and memory, Walker’s lab has discovered recent findings that sleep can refresh emotional brain reactivity, effectively ironing out our prior waking concerns and allowing for well rested, rational next day decisions. Dr. Walker will be in conversation with Amy Standen of QUEST, an award-winning multimedia science and environment series created by KQED in San Francisco. Her work has been recognized by the National Association of Public Radio News Directors and Northern California's Society of Professional Journalists. Standen has been a producer for Pulse of the Planet, editor of Terrain Magazine, an editor at Salon, a "roving reporter" for KALW's Philosophy Talk, and frequent NPR contributor.  <i>7:30 pm; Tickets are $22-27 for adults, $20-25 for Academy members.

A student of Zen Master Seung Sahn and a founding member of the Cambridge Zen Center, his study and practice of yoga and Buddhist studies led him to integrate their teachings with those of Western science. His major research interests have focused on mind-body interactions for healing, clinical applications of mindfulness meditation training and the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on the brain, immune system and healthy emotional expression. MBSR combines meditation and Hatha yoga to help patients cope with stress, pain, and illness by using moment-to-moment awareness and is now being taught at over 200 top medical centers around the world, and offered at hospitals, schools, prisons and in professional sports. Kabat-Zinn will be in conversation with Kelly McGonigal, PhD, a health psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University, and a leading expert in the new field of “science-help.” She is the author of <i>Yoga for Pain Relief</i>, which translates recent advances in neuroscience and medicine into mind-body strategies for relieving chronic pain, stress, depression, and anxiety.

Passionate about French wine, he was dedicated to supporting producers who represented the best of their region and appellation, but above all whose wines were pure, with minimal external influence and/or manipulation. Kermit’s quest, as he describes it, took a most important turn in 1973, when he was invited to join one of his importers on his annual buying trip to Burgundy where he met countless farmers, winemakers and négociants interested in having their wines represented in the US.

Dr. Blackburn studies the evolution and diversity of amphibians, especially frogs, on continental Africa. Nearly 90% of the 6,800 known species of amphibians are frogs. Their diversity and distribution make them prime research subjects for investigating larger questions about the history and movement of life within Africa and the origins and evolution of natural variation. Blackburn’s research involves both extensive use of museum collections and field expeditions. His passion for the people and wildlife of Africa has taken him to diverse habitats in many African countries, most recently in the mountains of Burundi and soon to the desert oases of North Africa. <i>7:00 pm; Tickets are $12 for adults; $10 for seniors; free for Academy members.

Dr. Berger will show recent observations from the Japanese/US/UK Hinode mission, and the NASA STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions that reveal strange new flows in solar prominences and coronal cavities, the structures that comprise so-called "coronal mass ejections" or CMEs. CMEs are the drivers of all large particle and magnetic storms in the solar system and understanding, and ultimately predicting, this "space weather" is a major goal of modern space physics. <i>7:30pm; Purchase tickets in advance online at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/event_tickets" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/event_tickets</a>, or by calling 415.379.8000.

The breast is an evolutionary masterpiece, but in the modern world, the breast is changing. Breasts are getting bigger, arriving earlier and attracting newfangled chemicals. What makes breasts so mercurial – and so vulnerable? The intrepid science journalist Florence Williams sets out to uncover the latest science from the fields of anthropology, biology, and medicine. Her investigation follows the life cycle of the breast from puberty to pregnancy to menopause, bringing her from a plastic surgeon’s office where she learns about the importance of cup size in Texas to a lab where she discovers the presence of environmental toxins in her own breast milk.

Can it feel an insect’s spindly legs? How do flowers know when it’s spring? Can they actually remember the weather? And do they care if you play them Led Zeppelin or Bach? From Darwin’s early fascination with stems and vines to Little Shop of Horrors, we have always marveled at plant diversity and form. Now, in <i>What a Plant Knows</i>, renowned biologist Daniel Chamovitz presents an intriguing and refreshing look at how plants experience the world. Highlighting the latest research in plant science, he takes us into the lives of different types of plants, and draws parallels with the human senses to reveal that we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize. <i>7:00 pm; Tickets are $12 for adults; $10 for seniors; free for Academy members.

THE DARK UNIVERSE OF BROWN DWARFS<br>   Featuring Professor Adam Burgasser, Center for Astrophysics and Space Science, UC San Diego<br>   Monday, August 6 at 7:30 pm</b><br><i>A Benjamin Dean astronomy lecture</i><br>   For thousands of years, humans have distinguished two types of bright celestial lights: the firmament of the fixed stars and the clockwork machinations of the wandering planets. With the discovery of a vast population of brown dwarfs— low-mass objects exhibiting both stellar and planetary characteristics— these long-held distinctions have been upended, revealing a continuum of gas giants spanning Jupiter to the Sun. Professor Burgasser will describe the history of brown dwarf science, from their prediction as dark matter candidates in the 1960s to their discovery as the Sun's nearest neighbors in the 1990s. He'll then reveal their many fascinating properties, from interiors of metallic hydrogen to storms of molten iron, and report on the recent discovery of "room-temperature" stars with the WISE infrared satellite mission. <i>7:30pm; Purchase tickets in advance online at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/event_tickets" target="_blank">www.calacademy.org/event_tickets</a>, or by calling 415.379.8000.

Now we can see inside our genomes to find things like earwax alleles, Parkinson’s disease risk, warfarin response risk, ancient maternal haplogroups, and even Neanderthal genes. But personal genomics isn’t just high-tech navel-gazing; it’s a powerful tool for grasping human evolutionary biology. Once the technology becomes good enough and the price comes down far enough, nearly everyone will have access to this high-resolution fascination with ourselves, our origins, and our evolution. As it enters the mainstream, personal genomics conjures intriguing new questions about its potential impact on our species, like: How will it change public perception of the science of human evolution and humanity’s place in nature? How will it affect personal identities and species perspectives? How will it shape conceptions of our future evolution?<i> 7:30 pm; Tickets are $15 for adults, $12 for seniors and $12 for Leakey Foundation and Academy members.

This movement is the brainchild of Michael Soule, founder of conservation biology and peer of E.O. Wilson and Paul Ehrlich, who endorse his effort as necessary for protecting the continued existence of nature on our continent. With blue-ribbon scientific foundations, the Spine is a grassroots, cooperative effort among conservation activists – NGOs large and small, and regular people across the country. <i>The Spine of the Continent</i> is not only about making physical connections so that nature will persist; it is about making connections between people and the land we call home.

There are fascinating discoveries to be made in her work, from new species of nudibranchs to unexpected life forms that blur the lines of flora and fauna to how we discern flashpoints through unlikely pairings like perceptions of danger in tranquil settings. In Bozic’s art, we find mesmerizing dialogue at work, encompassing both inner and outer worlds. Bozic is inspired by John James Audubon and Ernst Haeckel, but dives more deeply into the imaginary and darker aspects of the natural world. She has spoken at art and design conferences and shown work in galleries throughout the United States and Europe. More recently, she is coming off a highly anticipated and successful show at the Joshua Liner Gallery in New York City. Please join us for an intimate evening presentation and book signing with the artist to follow.&nbsp;<i>6:00 pm; This is a free event.

Supernovae, the main source of the iron in our bodies, have had a profound impact on science for centuries. More recently, particular explosions—called "Ia" supernovae—were used to make precise measurements of distance that revealed the mysterious acceleration of the universe. Despite their importance, scientists still do not know what sort of star (or stars) lead to such supernovae, nor do they understand in detail the mechanisms responsible for such explosions. Well-studied nearby supernovae, which could shed light on these deep mysteries, are uncommon. This past year, a rare Type Ia supernova dubbed SN2011fe was discovered in the Pinwheel Galaxy. Dr. Bloom, one of the researchers who facilitated the discovery and subsequent observations, will discuss some of the breakthrough results from SN 2011fe in the context of supernova science as well as some of the broader implications of the discovery. <i>7:30pm; Purchase tickets in advance online at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/event_tickets">www.calacademy.org/event_tickets</a>, or by calling (415) 379-8000.

She was fascinated by the experience to the point that she has been on a quest to understand the life cycle and evolutionary history of pathogens ever since. Hear about her research as she discusses fascinating examples from her work, such as how the dengue virus continues to evolve and plague humans since jumping over from non-human primates decades ago. Learn how this virus has adapted to humans and the mosquitoes that have in turn become so well adapted to us. With these questions, Dr. Bennett’s work broadens the Academy’s research scope to include a dedicated focus on viruses and bacteria. As you will discover, she is especially interested in the nature of genetic mutations that give viruses the potential to cause epidemics or switch to new hosts. <i> 7:00 pm; Tickets are $12 for adults; $10 for seniors; free for Academy members.

More recently, he and his colleagues showed that preventing the extinction of polar bears is largely a matter of controlling greenhouse gas rise. The good news is that prompt action to arrest greenhouse gas rise will preserve sustainable polar bear populations over much of their current range. Even more importantly, acting in time to save polar bears will benefit the rest of life on earth—including humans.<i> 7:30 pm; Tickets are $15 for adults; $12 for seniors; $12 for Academy members.

Twenty-one dioramas arranged in geographic order showcase a variety of mounted and live African animals, handcrafted rocks and plants, and meticulously painted backdrops, giving millions of visitors an in-depth look into Africa ’s diverse ecosystems.<br><br></p>                    <b>History</b>           <p>  The original African Hall opened in 1934 with 24 dioramas, and it quickly became a San Francisco icon. Leslie Simson, a San Francisco-born mining engineer, donated $300,000 for its construction. He also led a 1930 expedition to collect specimens for the hall, believing in the educational value and importance of creating a record of Africa ’s vanishing wildlife. Frank Tose, then Chief of Exhibits at the Academy, sketched and photographed the actual localities where the specimens were collected to ensure that each diorama would be true to life. <br><br></p> 		           <b>Saving the Past</b>             <p class="MsoPlainText">While it was not possible to save the original African Hall in its entirety, the outer two limestone walls of the hall were conserved for aesthetic and historical value; they are the only structures from the old Academy that are present in the new building. In order to faithfully recreate the dioramas, extensive photographs, video footage, and paint samples were taken in the old African Hall before demolition began in 2004.  The mounted animals were saved, cleaned, and repaired for re-use.  Ceiling tiles and other architectural details were recreated from casts of the originals.    </p>                         <b>Enhancing the New</b>                <p class="MsoPlainText">Although much of Tusher African Hall looks identical to the original, the visitor experience is enhanced with some surprising new elements.&nbsp; Five of the dioramas contain live animals.  Human evolution is also addressed in the hall, sharing the message that “We are all Africans.”  Redesigned interpretative panels and plasma touch-screens allow visitors to dive deeper into the animals’ habitats and their adaptations. And one of the dioramas—the Somali arid zone—features a video projection of elephants walking in the background.  </p>                         <b>List of Dioramas</b>               <div style="margin-left: -22px"> <ul><li>Twelve dioramas are exact replicas of the originals: mountain gorilla, bushbuck, olive baboons, lions, cheetah, roan antelope, sable antelope, klipspringer, black lechwe, Hunter’s hartebeest, Kirk’s dik dik, and hunting dogs</li><li>Four dioramas have been newly created: Namib desert; Cape  Floristic Province; montane forest with colobus monkeys, bongo, and duiker; and a Somali arid zone, which is a double-wide diorama with no glass barrier, containing Grevy’s zebras, antelopes, a leopard, and virtual elephants walking in the background</li><li>Five dioramas contain live animals: African penguins, white-throated monitor, Lake  Malawi cichlids, Jackson’s chameleon, and a pancake tortoise with great plated lizards.</li></ul></div>           <b>African Penguins </b><br>             <div style="margin-left: -22px"> <ul><li>The Academy’s African penguin colony is located at the end of the hall.

Cabrol, Planetary Scientist at the Carl Sagan Center, SETI Institute</i><br></b> The last decade has seen a revolution in astrobiology—the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. Results returned by planetary missions in the solar system such as Messenger, Venus Express, the Mars Exploration Rovers, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Express, MSL and the Curiosity Rover, Cassini, and Kepler, as well as multi-disciplinary research in terrestrial extreme environments have resulted in a new, inclusive, vision of astrobiology. What we learn from one planet helps us understand others, including our own, and guides the design and planning of future astrobiology-focused missions. In her presentation, Dr. Cabrol will discuss this revolution in astrobiology, with the latest updates from these various missions, and where we stand on our quest to understanding habitability and finding life beyond Earth. <i>Tickets are $12 per person, $10 for seniors and $8 for Academy members.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 8, 2013) – When San Francisco hosts the America’s Cup races this summer, the boats won’t be the only speed demons on display. Sailfish, tuna, sharks, and other swift swimmers—some of which can top even the fastest sailboats—take center stage in <i>Built for Speed</i>, a new exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences. From May 10 - September 29, 2013, <i>Built for Speed</i> encourages visitors to explore some of the ocean’s fastest animals and their fascinating adaptations—from streamlined body shapes and retractable fins to piston-like muscles.  In addition, visitors can witness museum staff and volunteers assembling an orca skeleton, examine a 45-foot-long catamaran and wingmast from ORACLE TEAM USA (the America’s Cup defending champions), compare the forms that make these ocean racers fast in fluid, and learn the steps they can take to support ocean conservation.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Competition has driven the evolution of the ocean’s fastest inhabitants, as well as the design of the world’s most extreme racing vessels,” said Dr. Greg Farrington, Executive Director of the Academy.  “This summer, the Academy will offer racing enthusiasts a chance to explore the links between fast animals and fast boats—between natural selection in the wild and design optimization in the lab.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Academy is the Official Education Partner of ORACLE TEAM USA, Defender of the 34th America’s Cup. The America’s Cup is the oldest trophy in international sport. Founded in 1851, the competition will be held in San Francisco Bay—a natural sailing arena—for the first time this year, with teams racing AC72 wing sail catamarans. Racing starts with the Louis Vuitton Cup (the America’s Cup Challenger Series) in July and August, and the winner will face ORACLE TEAM USA in the America’s Cup Finals in September.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p><b>EXHIBIT OVERVIEW</b><br><i>Built for Speed</i> is located in and around the Academy’s central piazza.  The exhibit includes models of some of the ocean’s fastest swimmers, along with the orca skeleton and 45-foot-long racing catamaran.<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Fast Marine Animals</b><br> Models of an Indo-Pacific sailfish, yellowfin tuna, and shortfin mako shark demonstrate the amazing adaptations these animals have evolved for speed and long-distance ocean travel. The <b>sailfish </b>is one of the world’s fastest fishes, capable of short sprints over 60 mph with the help of its streamlined body, retractable dorsal fin, pointed bill, and stiff, crescent-shaped tail. The <b>yellowfin tuna</b> is no slouch either, able to swim in bursts over 40 mph thanks to its torpedo-shaped body, internal heat regulation, and piston-like muscles near its backbone that drive its tail back and forth. The <b>shortfin mako shark</b>, the fastest known shark species, can reach bursts of over 40 mph and has been recorded migrating up to 2,500 miles. But fish don’t hold the monopoly on speedy travel—the spineless squid darts through the water with a fascinating jet propulsion system. A <b>Humboldt squid</b> model allows visitors to examine its adaptations. After comparing the forms of these fast animals and understanding the basic physics of drag and thrust, visitors can put their knowledge to the test by making a fictitious fast fish out of fanciful fins and body shapes.<br>&nbsp;</li>  <li><b>Orca Lab</b><br> The orca is one of the world’s fastest marine mammals.  Its large size, strength, and ability to echolocate all contribute to its prowess as a hunter.  In November 2011, a deceased <b>18-foot-long juvenile orca</b> washed ashore at Point Reyes National Seashore in Northern California.  Academy researchers and volunteers responded to the stranding and identified the orca as an offshore ecotype.  Since little is known about this population, the skeleton was retrieved and transported to the Academy for future scientific study.  Through June 9, 2013, visitors can watch as Academy staff and volunteers carefully assemble the skeleton—a jigsaw puzzle of whale-sized proportions.  The completed skeleton will be on view for the duration of the exhibit.<br>&nbsp;</li>  <li><b>Ocean Action</b><br> Plastic waste, wastewater pollution, and unsustainable fishing are three major threats to the health of the oceans today.  Throughout the exhibit, <b>“Ocean Action” stations</b> constructed out of manmade marine debris encourage visitors to pass on plastic, clean up the flow, and be seafood savvy.  In addition, community-based initiatives offering tips for taking conservation action are highlighted.  Visitors can also tweet their own ideas for creatively re-using plastic with the Twitter hashtag #ReimaginePlastic.<br>&nbsp;</li>  <li><b>Built to Race</b><br> The Academy is the only Bay Area institution to display an <b>AC45 catamaran and its wing from ORACLE TEAM USA</b>, who won the most recent America’s Cup in 2010.  Suspended just outside the piazza, this wingsail multihull boat has a hull length of 45 feet, a mast height of 84 feet, and a total weight of 3,086 pounds.  It can attain speeds of more than 35 mph.  ORACLE TEAM USA raced AC45 catamarans in the America’s Cup World Series from 2011 to 2013, and they will sail the even larger, 72-foot-long versions in the 2013 America’s Cup Finals.  With this high-tech example of a manmade racing machine above their heads, visitors can gain a sense of the extreme nature of the sport, and explore how competition drives both natural selection in the wild and design optimization in the lab.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b><br>  During the summer of 2013, Academy educators offer daily and weekly programs in support of the exhibit’s marine biology and conservation themes.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO&nbsp;&nbsp;(March 5, 2014) – The California Academy of Sciences is pleased to announce the appointment of Dylan&nbsp;Burge, Ph.D. as Assistant Curator and the new Howell Chair of Western North American Botany.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Northern California native who had filled his own greenhouse with several thousand plants by the&nbsp;time he graduated from high school, Burge completed his undergraduate degree in Evolution and Ecology at University of California, Davis. He then received his Ph.D. in plant genetics from Duke University and conducted postdoctoral work in both Australia and British Columbia. Most recently, he was the Rose Postdoctoral Fellow in the Botany Department at the Academy, where he studied the evolution of western plant species as well as the ways that California’s diverse soil types influence the distribution of plants across the state.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Among his varied research projects, Burge is currently studying the evolution of an unusual plant trait: heavy metal hyperaccumulation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">"It's almost hard to imagine, but some plants that grow on metal-rich soils are able to "mine" these metals from the ground,” says Burge. “They end up storing metal, such as nickel, in their tissues, up to 4% of the plant mass.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Burge is working to identify the genes responsible for this unique “mining” ability and to reveal how the trait evolved. His research has potential applications for both heavy metal mining and toxic waste cleanup—once the plants have accumulated metal from the soil, the metals can be cleanly extracted from the plants.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">As the Academy’s Howell Chair of Western North American Botany, Burge will bring a global perspective to his research studying native California plants.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">“Despite more than 150 years of botanical documentation in western North America, vast areas remain unexplored in terms of botany,” says Burge. “More than 80% of the land area of California, for example, is unknown from a botanical perspective.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">“California is a biodiversity hotspot–there are a tremendous number of plant and animal species here that live nowhere else in the world,” says Terry Gosliner, Senior Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the California Academy of Sciences. “Dylan is an ideal person to pursue this important work to better understand the native species in our own backyard.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Burge recognizes that when it comes to the plants of western North America, there is more undocumented flora than he could ever hope to record on his own.&nbsp; He is now developing a program he refers to as “Citizen Floristics,” which will enlist the help of anyone interested in native plants.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">“I hope to use citizen scientists to help meet the need,” says Burge. “There are a huge number of amateur botanists and collectors in the western United States who could be tapped to improve our documentation.”</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">According to Burge, such knowledge will improve our understanding of how native plants evolved across the landscape.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 6, 2013) – Starting today, the California Academy of Sciences is presenting a dazzling, high-impact space show, <i>Cosmic Collisions</i>, inside Morrison Planetarium.  Narrated by Robert Redford, the all-digital show features images from space and immersive visualizations based on scientific data, revealing the explosive encounters that shaped our solar system, changed the course of life on Earth, and continue to transform our galaxy and Universe.  <i>Cosmic Collisions</i> will alternate with <i>Earthquake: Evidence of a Restless Planet</i> and will play daily* through January 30, 2014.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p><i>Cosmic Collisions</i> presents a view of the cosmos that is radically different from our everyday experience watching the peaceful night sky. Collisions are common occurrences in space and are currently understood by scientists as a key mechanism in the evolution of the Universe. They are the spectacular and inevitable result of gravity pulling together objects such as planets, stars, and galaxies, which are in constant motion through space. The show re-creates a full range of collisions that are usually invisible to us, either because they unfold over vast expanses of time and space, spanning billions of years and trillions of miles (as in the clash of galaxies), or because they occur almost instantaneously on a subatomic scale (as in the collision of protons in the heart of the Sun).<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>Scene-by-Scene Description</b></p>  <p><i>Cosmic Collisions</i> starts quietly, with a view of the deceptively peaceful night sky.  But viewers soon encounter a <b>comet approaching Earth</b>. The comet misses, but bits of rock from the comet’s tail, called meteoroids, burn up spectacularly and harmlessly in the Earth’s atmosphere.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The audience is then transported back in time to witness a wandering planet-sized object explosively crashing into the young Earth about 4.5 billion years ago. In the aftermath of the collision, the swirling mass of molten debris that circles Earth starts to coalesce.  The narrator explains that we are witnessing the <b>birth of our own Moon</b>, which took place over a single month, according to scientific simulations. This major milestone in our planet’s history was responsible for the tilt of Earth’s axis and therefore our seasons. The Moon’s gravitational pull causes the ebb and flow of the ocean’s tides.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Other collisions affect us each and every day. Protons colliding in the process of nuclear fusion generate the Sun’s tremendous energy. This energy, in the form of light, creates the ideal conditions for life to flourish on our planet. Viewers witness in remarkable detail the turbulent face of our Sun in spectacular images captured by NASA satellites, with <b>huge fiery storms that spew out mountains of ionized particles </b>that hurtle towards Earth at more than a million miles an hour. The blustery streams of charged particles from the Sun—the solar wind—could endanger all life on Earth by sweeping away large portions of our upper atmosphere, but Earth’s magnetic field repels the solar particles like a protective cocoon.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>As charged particles strike the Earth’s magnetic field, some of these particles make it through to the upper atmosphere, producing the stunning glow of the <b>aurora borealis, or “northern lights,”</b> which the audience views from a vantage point high in outer space.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p><i>Cosmic Collisions</i> then goes back in time to a re-creation of a catastrophic event that changed the course of life on Earth. Using data from Los Alamos National Laboratory, viewers experience an immersive simulation of an enormous meteorite impact that heated the Earth’s atmosphere in a flaming shroud and hastened the <b>end of the Age of Dinosaurs 65 million years ago</b>. The ensuing destruction and darkness, combined with the subsequent volcanic eruptions and changing sea levels, obliterated almost three-quarters of all life on Earth. But the impact also cleared the way for mammals—and eventually humans—to thrive.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Can such a catastrophic event like this happen again? The show visualizes a possible future scenario that has frequently been the subject of news stories, novels, and blockbuster movies—<b>a devastating impact of a large asteroid on Earth</b>. There’s less than a one-in-a-million chance in any given year that an asteroid over one kilometer in diameter will hit Earth. The show explores how such a collision might be averted, pointing out that, contrary to popular wisdom, the best option may not be blowing up the asteroid, because that could produce dangerous fragments; the best approach may be pulling the asteroid safely out of the path of destruction using the small gravitational pull of a spacecraft. In a dramatic scene, a “doomsday” asteroid barely misses Earth after being successfully tugged off course by the gravity of a spacecraft flying alongside.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The show then takes the audience outside Earth’s orbit, on a soaring journey to the outskirts of the Milky Way to witness the densely packed stars in a distant globular cluster. Unlike most of space, where there are great distances between objects, the stars in these clusters are crammed together, making collisions more likely. Viewers witness how <b>gravity brings together two small stars</b> to form a larger, rejuvenated star—a rare cosmic smash-up that, even in the heart of a globular cluster, occurs only once every 100,000 years.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>Finally, shifting billions of years into the future, the show predicts <b>an encounter of staggering proportions as two galaxies collide</b>. Our Milky Way galaxy runs headlong into its closest neighbor, the Andromeda spiral galaxy, a cosmic merging that produces a new giant elliptical galaxy. As the narrator explains, “Stars and planets in these galaxies won’t actually collide. They’re much too far apart. Scientists think they’ll simply slide past one another.” Using astrophysical research to create 3D visualizations of an intergalactic ballet, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies swirl and stretch away from each other before coming back together again. From this single simulated sequence—where each second indicates the passage of 40 million years—viewers see how cosmic collisions have shaped the Universe’s myriad galaxies and how our familiar Milky Way was formed by collisions among many smaller galaxies over vast expanses of time.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Staying true to the tradition of Morrison Planetarium, the show includes an <b>interlude with a live presenter</b>, who takes viewers on a virtual journey to Arizona, Canada, and Russia to look at the evidence of more recent impacts, including the surprise explosion at Chelyabinsk, Russia, in February 2013.  A flight away from Earth reveals the estimated number of asteroids orbiting near our planet, reminding us that we live in a dynamic solar system.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><i>Cosmic Collisions</i> was developed in 2006 by the American Museum of Natural History, New York, in collaboration with the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science; GOTO, Inc., Tokyo, Japan; and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, China.  The show was created with the major support and partnership of NASA, Science Missions Directorate, Heliophysics Division.<br>&nbsp;</p>

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (November 21, 2013) – Starting January 31, 2014, the California Academy of Sciences will present its newest planetarium space show, <i>Dark Universe</i>. Featuring exquisite renderings of enigmatic cosmic phenomena, seminal scientific instruments, and spectacular scenes in deep space, <i>Dark Universe</i>, developed by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City, in collaboration with the Academy and GOTO Inc., celebrates the pivotal discoveries that have led us to greater knowledge of the structure and history of the Universe and our place in it—and to new frontiers for exploration. Now showing at AMNH, <i>Dark Universe</i> whisks audiences out of the Milky Way galaxy, drops them alongside a parachute descending through Jupiter’s atmosphere, and brings them all the way to the cosmic microwave background while revealing the breakthroughs that have led astronomers to confront two great cosmic mysteries: dark matter and dark energy. <b><i>Dark Universe</i> will play daily in the Academy’s Morrison Planetarium through October 9, 2014. </b></p><br><p>“The Academy strives to bring the finest immersive content to our audiences,” said Ryan Wyatt, Director of Morrison Planetarium and Science Visualization at the Academy. “<i>Dark Universe</i> knits cutting-edge cosmological visualizations into a complex and compelling narrative. It breaks new ground in helping viewers understand the origin and evolution of the Universe, and I believe that audiences will leave the show inspired by a science-driven but deeply affecting perspective on humanity’s place in the cosmos.”</p><br><p>Created by an award-winning team that includes astrophysicists and science visualization experts, <i>Dark Universe</i> is an immersive theater experience based on authentic data from NASA and European Space Agency missions, ground-based telescopes, supercomputer simulations, and research conducted at institutions around the globe. It begins with a scene millions of light years away from Earth. After flying to our own Milky Way galaxy, viewers arrive at California’s Mount Wilson Observatory, where Edwin Hubble’s discovery that the Universe is expanding first pointed to the Big Bang. That initial discovery, and ever more sensitive instruments on the ground and in space, led to other breakthroughs that have given astronomers an increasingly detailed and precise picture of how our Universe formed and evolved.</p><br><p>But these revelations have also uncovered intriguing new mysteries. What is the so-called dark energy accelerating cosmic expansion? What is the invisible dark matter underlying galaxies that, together with dark energy, accounts for at least 95 percent of the Universe’s total energy and mass? What lies beyond our cosmic horizon?<i> Dark Universe</i> explores this new age of cosmic discovery. </p><br><p><i>Dark Universe</i> is curated by Dr. Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, a curator in the Department of Astrophysics and Division of Physical Sciences at AMNH who studies the formation and evolution of planets, stars, and galaxies. </p><br><p>“This Space Show is not just about what we know about the Universe but how we know it so well,” said Mac Low. “The major accomplishment of the last decade in cosmology has been going from rather general knowledge about the Universe to knowing its properties to within a few percent. The astonishing result is that the Universe has turned out to be a very odd place, like nothing anybody ever expected.”</p><br><p>Narrating the new planetarium show is Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist, prolific science communicator, and the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at AMNH. Dr. Tyson is working on a 21st-century reboot of Carl Sagan’s landmark television series COSMOS, set to air on FOX in spring 2014. <i>Dark Universe</i> is directed by Carter Emmart, the director of astrovisualization at AMNH and one of the original team members of the NASA-funded Digital Galaxy Project, now known as the Digital Universe, which helped redefine how planetarium theaters present science to the public through immersive data visualization. The show was written by best-selling Bay Area science writer Timothy Ferris and scored by composer Robert Miller. </p><br><p><i>Dark Universe</i> was developed by the American Museum of Natural History, New York (<a href="http://www.amnh.org/" target="_blank">www.amnh.org</a>), in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, and GOTO Inc., Tokyo, Japan, and in partnership with the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 29, 2013) — Dr. Robert Drewes, curator of herpetology at the California Academy of Sciences, was appointed this month to the Scientific Advisory Council for the African island of Principe.  Principe Regional President Jose Cassandra, as well as Sao Tome and Principe Prime Minister Gabriel Costa, acknowledged Drewes’ ongoing contribution to the understanding of the island’s biological diversity, during a May 4 ceremony in Principe celebrating its international recognition as a World Biosphere Reserve.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>“It has been very gratifying to have the Academy’s work be a part of creating the country’s first World Biosphere Reserve,” said Drewes. “These islands are truly unique yet poorly known.”<br>&nbsp;</p>	  <p>Organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), World Biosphere Reserves are sites established by countries to promote sustainable development based on local community efforts and sound science. As places that seek to reconcile conservation of biological and cultural diversity with economic and social development, World Biosphere Reserves are recognized as sites of excellence that share their learnings through regional and international networks. There are currently 621 biosphere reserves in 117 countries, including 47 in the United States.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Over a span of 40 years, Drewes has embarked on numerous expeditions to Africa, where he has focused on the evolutionary relationships, natural history, and biogeography of amphibians and reptiles.  Since 2001, he has focused his attention on Sao Tome and Principe, located in the Gulf of Guinea off Africa’s west coast. Although it is a tiny nation—at 370 square miles, only about eight times the size of San Francisco—the two islands host a number of plants, fungi, birds, reptiles, and amphibians found nowhere else on Earth, including the highest concentration of endemic birds in the world by area.  Over the past 13 years, Drewes has organized seven multidisciplinary expeditions to the islands in an effort to document their unique biodiversity and gather data for conservation plans.  These expeditions have included more than 40 scientists and their graduate students.  Last year, Drewes provided a substantial body of biological information, including lists and photographs of flora and fauna, to the committee applying for Principe’s inclusion as a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>About Research at the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability at the California Academy of Sciences is at the forefront of efforts to understand two of the most important topics of our time: the nature and future of life on Earth.

			<div id="pr_header"><b>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GREGORY FARRINGTON <br>ANNOUNCES PLANS TO RETIRE IN JULY 2014</b>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 25, 2013) – Dr. Gregory C. Farrington, Executive Director of the California Academy of Sciences, has announced that he will retire from his position at the Academy at the end of the current fiscal year, which closes on June 30, 2014. Farrington has served as the head of the Academy for nearly seven years, overseeing the opening of its award-winning new facility in Golden Gate Park and guiding the institution’s programs of scientific research, education, and public engagement.</p>  <br><p>The Academy’s Board of Trustees will form a committee to conduct an international search for a new Executive Director, who will replace Farrington when he retires next summer. </p>   <br><p>“It has been a great honor to lead this renowned institution through such a transformative chapter in its 160-year history,” says Farrington. “We set out not only to open a new building, but to reinvent the role of natural history institutions in today’s world, and we have made tremendous strides in that direction—focusing our efforts on some of the most pressing scientific questions of our time, integrating our scientists and research collections more fully into every facet of the institution, and laying the foundation for becoming a truly global Academy that reaches audiences around the world. This beloved institution is beautifully poised to play a central role in shaping the science and issues that will determine the world we leave to our children, and it’s the right time to start looking for a new leader to bring it into that future.”</p> <br><p>When Farrington joined the Academy in early 2007, a record-setting new building expected to receive a LEED Platinum rating from the U.S. Green Building Council was under construction in Golden Gate Park. Farrington turned his attention to the programs of research, education, and public engagement that would take place in that new home, ensuring that they would be every bit as “Platinum” as the building itself.</p>   <br><p>Farrington has focused the Academy’s programs on two of the most important questions of our time: “How did life evolve?” and “How can we sustain it?”  The only institution in the world to combine a museum, aquarium, and planetarium, as well as innovative programs of public engagement, global exploration, and education, the Academy is uniquely positioned to explore these questions. </p>   <br><p>“Greg has brought great vision, passion and wisdom to his role at the Academy,” says John C. Atwater, Chairman of the Academy’s Board of Trustees. “From day one, he recognized that opening a remarkable new building was just the first step in the Academy’s journey to re-imagine the role of institutions like ours, insisting that everything inside the building—from the Academy’s guest services operation to its efforts to explore, explain and sustain life—must be every bit as revolutionary as the building itself. Under his guidance, the Academy has pioneered innovative new approaches to everything from digital learning programs for teens to rapid dissemination of scientific research results. We are fortunate to have Greg’s continued leadership and dedication as we search for a successor.” </p> <br><p>During Farrington’s tenure as Executive Director, the Academy’s reach and impact have increased dramatically. Between 2003, when the institution closed its previous facility in Golden Gate Park, and today, the Academy’s annual attendance has doubled from about 750,000 to 1.5 million, and the number of students it serves through fieldtrips and after school programs has nearly tripled from 62,000 to 175,000. Additionally, annual fund giving has grown from just under $3 million to $15 million, and the grant dollars awarded to Academy scientists and educators each year have doubled.</p> <br><p>In addition to doubling the number of visitors who engage with science and the natural world inside this new building, the Academy has also launched a number of initiatives under Farrington’s leadership designed to reach global audiences who may never get the chance to visit San Francisco. For instance, the Academy’s own award-winning planetarium productions are distributed to domes and universities around world, many of the Academy’s programs and lectures now have more online viewers than physical attendees, and the Academy’s “Science Today” videos and stories appear on digital media outlets around the globe. </p>  <br><p>“Greg realized that for the Academy to become a truly global leader in science education and research, it would have to become a museum without walls, serving people not just here in Golden Gate Park but around the world,” says Trustee Randi Fisher. “In addition to looking for opportunities to share the Academy’s content more widely with international audiences, he also forged important partnerships with institutions such as UCSF, The Gladstone Institute, Conservation International, and Google, bringing increased visibility to the Academy and creating vibrant new models for public engagement with science.”</p>  <br><p>Farrington has often pointed out that one of the Academy’s most powerful and differentiated assets is its staff of active scientists, who travel the globe to explore the remarkable diversity of life and ways to sustain it. He has focused on integrating these explorers fully into the fabric of the institution, profiling their work prominently in the Academy’s exhibits and programs and creating new opportunities for visitors to engage with them directly.</p>  <br><p>“From <i>NightLife</i> to <i>Chat with a Scientist</i>, our innovative programs of public engagement give our visitors the opportunity to engage personally with world-class scientists and explorers,” says Farrington.  “The Academy truly is a public stage for science at a time when the challenge of understanding life and sustaining it will drive innovation for many decades—even centuries—to come.” </p>  <br><p>September 27 will mark the five year anniversary of the Academy’s new building in Golden Gate Park—a natural time to reflect on the many achievements of the past five years as well as the opportunities that beckon in the future.</p>  <br><p>“The New Academy—from opening day until today—has been a spectacular success,” says Farrington. “I look forward to leading this beloved institution through at least a few more milestones in the coming months. The Academy’s mission of public education and engagement about life and sustainability has never, in its long 160 year history, been more important.” </p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 3, 2013) — The old saying “You are what you eat” takes on new significance in the most comprehensive analysis to date of early human teeth from Africa.  Prior to about 3.5 million years ago, early humans dined almost exclusively on leaves and fruits from trees, shrubs, and herbs—similar to modern-day gorillas and chimpanzees.   However, about 3.5 million years ago, early human species like <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> and <i>Kenyanthropus platyops</i> began to also nosh on grasses, sedges, and succulents—or on animals that ate those plants.  Evidence of this significant dietary expansion is written in the chemical make-up of our ancestors’ teeth.  These findings are reported in a series of four papers published this week in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, by an international group of scientists spread over three continents.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>“These papers present the most exhaustive isotope-based studies on early human diets to date,” said Dr. Zeresenay Alemseged, Senior Curator and Chair of Anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences, and co-author on two of the papers. “Because feeding is the most important factor determining an organism’s physiology, behavior, and its interaction with the environment, these finds will give us new insight into the evolutionary mechanisms that shaped our evolution.”<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Plants can be divided into three categories based on their method of photosynthesis: C3, C4, and CAM.  C3 plants (trees, shrubs, and herbs) can be chemically distinguished from C4/CAM plants (grasses, sedges, and succulents) because the latter incorporate higher amounts of the heavier isotope carbon-13 into their tissues.  When the plants are consumed, the isotopes become incorporated into the animal’s own tissues—including the enamel of developing teeth.  Even after millions of years, scientists can measure the relative amounts of carbon-13 in teeth enamel and infer the amount of C3 vs. C4/CAM plants in an animal’s diet.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>“What we have is chemical information on what our ancestors ate, which in simpler terms is like a piece of food item stuck between their teeth and preserved for millions of years,” said Alemseged.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>These papers represent the first time that scientists have analyzed carbon isotope data from all early human species for which significant samples exist: 175 specimens representing 11 species, ranging from 4.4 to 1.3 million years in age.  The results show that prior to 3.5 million years ago, early humans ate almost exclusively C3 plants.  But starting about 3.5 million years ago, early humans acquired the taste for C4/CAM plants as well, even though their environments seemed to be broadly similar to their ancestors’.  The later genus <i>Homo</i>, including modern-day <i>Homo sapiens</i>, continues the trend of eating a mixture of C3 and C4/CAM plants—in fact, people who enjoy mashed potatoes with corn are practicing a 3.5 million-year-old habit.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p>What the studies cannot reveal is the exact identity of the food, and whether it also included animals that ate C4/CAM plants (an equally valid way to acquire carbon-13).  Possible C4/CAM-derived meals include grass seeds and roots, sedge underground stems, termites, succulents, or even small game and scavenged carcasses.  In 2010, Alemseged and his research team published the earliest evidence for meat consumption using tools, dating back to 3.4 million years ago—an additional line of evidence showing a dietary shift in human evolution.<br>&nbsp;</p>    <p>“The change in isotopic signal documented by the new studies, coupled with the evidence for meat-eating in <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> from Dikika around 3.5 million years ago, suggests an expansion in the dietary adaptation of the species,” said Alemseged.<br>&nbsp;</p>   <p>The authors of this week’s papers also sampled fossils of giraffes, horses, and monkeys from the same environments and saw no significant change in their carbon isotope values over time—suggesting that the unique dietary transformation of early humans did not apply to other mammals on the African savanna.  The question of what drove the transformation, however, remains unresolved.<br>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b>About Research at the California Academy of Sciences</b><br> The Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability at the California Academy of Sciences is at the forefront of efforts to understand two of the most important topics of our time: the nature and future of life on Earth.

When Lucy's skeleton was discovered in 1974, it helped establish that this creature was an upright walking species, pushing the then accepted date for bipedalism back by a million years. Lucy's foot, knee and pelvis are all very humanlike. However, her upper body tells a different story, with features that are much more apelike, including long arms and curved fingers. For more than 35 years, scientists have debated whether or not these features suggest that Lucy's species also climbed trees. In this presentation, Dr. Alemseged discusses the evidence for climbing behavior in <i>A. afarensis</i> based on new analysis of his own find "Selam," currently the most complete and earliest skeleton of a juvenile human ancestor. <i>7:00 pm; Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for seniors, free for Academy members.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (January 28, 2014) — Science education is at the core of the California Academy of Sciences’ mission—and now it’s also at the fingertips of science enthusiasts around the world. The California Academy of Sciences has partnered with leading global learning platform Khan Academy to make an engaging new digital learning course entitled “Biodiversity” available for free to anyone worldwide. Khan Academy is a not-for-profit that provides free online educational materials (e.g., practice exercises, instructional videos, dashboard analytics, teacher tools) and currently reaches over 10 million users each month.</p><br><p>Khan Academy is changing the way people learn—making digital learning intellectually stimulating, readily accessible, and just plain fun,” says Dr. Elizabeth Babcock, Chief Public Engagement Officer and Roberts Dean of Education at the California Academy of Sciences. “We are thrilled to partner with this e-learning innovator to make engaging new videos, quizzes, activities, and lesson plans about biodiversity available to audiences around the world.  </p>  <br><p>Drawing on the deep knowledge and expertise of the California Academy of Sciences’ scientists, educators, and video production team, this new seven-part course explains biodiversity and its importance throughout the world. The first two tutorials are now available online at <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/CAS-biodiversity" target="_blank"> http://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/CAS-biodiversity</a>, and five additional tutorials will be launched over the coming year. </p>  <br><p>“Khan Academy is excited that students around the world will now have access to fantastic new tutorials from the scientists at the California Academy of Sciences,” says Salman Khan, Founder and Executive Director of Khan Academy. “These new videos, quizzes, articles, and activities will allow students to explore what ecosystems are and how they work and we think they’ll be a strong complement to our core Biology tutorials.” </p> <br><p>Designed for a wide variety of audiences, including high school students, teachers, families, policy makers, and anyone interested in learning more about the diversity of life, each tutorial in the new Biodiversity course includes video lessons, articles, and quizzes, as well as activities that encourage students to explore the natural world. </p> <br><p>“In addition to creating quizzes, activities, articles, and glossaries of scientific terms, we have also compiled selected references that include links to the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards,” says Dr. Meg Burke, Director of Teacher and Youth Education at the California Academy of Sciences. “In doing so, we hope teachers will find this course of interest and use.”  </p> <br><p>Dr. Rich Mooi, Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the California Academy of Sciences, is both the voice and artist behind each video in the course. A skilled scientific illustrator whose detailed drawings of sea urchins and other echinoderms grace dozens of scientific papers, Mooi can also sketch anything from a butterfly to a map of Antarctica in two seconds flat. Brought to life through clever animation and commentary, his sketches outline the what, where, when, and why-does-it-matter of biodiversity on our planet. </p> <br><p> “We chose biodiversity as the focus of this Khan Academy course because biodiversity is all around us,” says Mooi. “It's crucial to the quality of our lives and the lives of all other living organisms, but we still have a lot to learn about all the players and their roles in this pageantry of life. And it’s increasingly important for people to understand that we are losing biodiversity at a rate never before seen, driven by human actions resulting in habitat loss and extinction.”  </p> <br><p> Mooi’s animated drawings of an island archipelago serve as the organizational metaphor for creating specific tutorials on the topic of biodiversity. Mooi says this metaphor provides “a geography” for the content and encourages user exploration. </p> <br><p> “Each island represents a topic within an overarching Biodiversity Archipelago, the islands serving as a kind of inspirational structure for the course that keeps us on track,” says Mooi. “On each island, users can take intellectual hikes by watching the videos, taking the quizzes, and following their interests to wander further into particular topics.”</p> <br><p>The course launches with two islands of the archipelago available for exploration: “Why is biodiversity important?” and “Where do we find biodiversity?” Over the next several months, the California Academy of Sciences will be adding more islands and more hikes, as the course expands to address such topics as how biodiversity is documented, why it is threatened, how it can be protected, where it comes from, and what types of biodiversity exist. </p><br><p> “We hope that people will not only learn things from the course,” says Burke, “but will also be moved to become even more active stewards of the environment and its precious biodiversity.” </p>

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (December 20, 2013) – In 2013, researchers at the California Academy of Sciences discovered 91 new plant and animal species and two new genera, enriching our understanding of the complex web of life on Earth and strengthening our ability to make informed conservation decisions.  The new species, previously unknown to science, include 38 different ants, 12 fishes, 14 plants, eight beetles, two spiders, one reptile, and one amphibian.  In addition, Academy scientists discovered a new genus of beetle and a previously unidentified genus of sea fan.  More than a dozen Academy scientists along with several dozen international collaborators described the newly discovered plants and animals. <br><br></p><p>  Proving that there are still plenty of places to explore and things to discover on Earth, the scientists ventured into remote jungles and descended to the bottom of the sea, looked in their own backyards (California) and explored the other side of the world (Africa).  Their results, published in more than 30 scientific papers, help advance the Academy’s research into two of the most important scientific questions of our time: <i>“How did life evolve?”</i> and <i>“How will it persist?”</i> <br><br><br>"Our best estimates are that we have discovered and described less than 10 percent of the life forms on Earth,” says Dr. Terry Gosliner, Dean of Science and Research Collections at the Academy. “As we race to discover the other 90 percent of the species that make up the tapestry of life, we are focusing our efforts on global biodiversity hotspots—places that are both unusually diverse and highly threatened, including many tropical forests, coral reef communities, and our own backyard, California.”&nbsp;     <br><br></p><p>Below are a few highlights among the 91 species described by the Academy this year.  For a full list of species, including geographic information, email <a href="mailto:press@calacademy.org">press@calacademy.org</a>.<br> &nbsp;</p>      <p><b>Madagascar’s list of endemic species grows</b><br><br> The islands of the southwestern Indian Ocean, especially Madagascar, are composed of extremely fragmented natural habitats and are renowned for hosting many endemic species—those that cannot be found anywhere else on Earth.  This is a place the California Academy of Sciences considers a global biodiversity hotspot. However, Madagascar's biodiversity is increasingly threatened, adding new urgency to the research being conducted on the island. This year, Academy scientists were able to identify 38 previously unknown ant species, seven new plants, and two new spider species from Madagascar. </p><br><p> Academy scientist Brian Fisher, an entomologist who specializes in the study of ants, calls them "the glue that holds ecosystems together." </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ants are one of the most important members of ecosystems," says Fisher. "They turn over more soil than earthworms." But they're also some of the most overlooked, he says. "If they were bigger, they would be the most studied type of organism, but people don't see them." </p><br><p> Now, Fisher and his team are able to look for these small creatures in a new way. Recently, satellite companies and engineers from Google have provided Academy researchers with high-resolution satellite images of some of the least explored areas of Madagascar. Equipped with a GPS-enabled tablet loaded with customized software and recent high-res images, Fisher and his colleagues can identify which patches of forest are most likely to contain new species of ants based on their elevation, vegetation, and adjacent habitats.</p> <br><p> The work being done by Academy scientists is helping to correct a long-standing bias in habitat conservation. “If you base conservation on just vertebrates,” Fisher says, “it leads you to conclude that only the largest forests are important. Ants and other insects provide a better map of true biodiversity.”  </p> <br><p><b>New species unearthed close to home</b><br> &nbsp;</p>  <p>While researchers from the California Academy of Sciences are spanning the far reaches of the globe to find new plants, animals, and other life forms, there are still many things to discover closer to home.  In 2013, Academy scientists discovered two new plant species and eight new beetles from Mexico. </p><p><br>In his time as a naturalist, Charles Darwin was fascinated with beetles and amassed one of the world’s most important collections.  Today, researchers at the Academy are continuing that tradition.  On November 19, 2013, Igor Sokolov, a Schlinger Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Academy of Sciences, published a paper on ZooKeys, describing eight new species and a new genus of beetle. </p><p><br> According to Sokolov, these miniscule ground beetles remain largely uninvestigated. Prior to his recent discoveries, there were only two other species from two different genera described from Mexico.  These beetles rarely emerge and are so tiny that they have gone largely unnoticed. “These types of beetles live all over the world, including here in California, but are very difficult to collect,” says Dr. Dave Kavanaugh, Senior Curator of Entomology at the Academy.  “Even if you can isolate them from the dirt and leaf litter where they live,” Kavanaugh explains, “they’re no bigger than the head of a pin, so they are nearly impossible to see with the naked eye.” Then once you have found the beetles and get them back to the lab, it takes a steady hand to dissect them and tediously compare each specimen under a microscope.  “Igor is the only person I know who has good enough hands to do this work,” Kavanaugh says.  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The study of these beetles illustrates how isolation and slight changes in habitat can influence the evolutionary process. “These beetles are blind, flightless, and don’t move around very much, yet they are found in nearly every corner of the world,” says Kavanaugh.  “This tells us that they are probably ancient. They have evolved and diverged to succeed in lowland and highland elevations, from tropical islands to dry environments.  They’re practically everywhere and they’ve been there forever, but we’re only just now learning about them.”  Through this research, Academy scientists are carrying on the work of Charles Darwin. “And there are more species to come,” says Kavanaugh.<br> &nbsp;</p>        <p><b>A case of mistaken identity points to need for increased protections</b><br><br> This year, Academy scientists identified three new species of soft corals and two new species and a new genus of sea fan found off the Pacific coast. </p><p><br>For 100 years, the fiery red sea fan with long, elegant branches had been lumped in with 36 other species of <i>Euplexaura</i>, until Academy octocoral expert Gary Williams was able to set the record straight. After comparing a colony collected off the coast of San Francisco to older samples in the Academy’s collection, Williams announced an entirely new genus—and challenged our assumptions about familiar waters. Major cities, as Williams pointed out to Live Science, “aren’t places you’d think there are still discoveries waiting to be made.”  </p><p><br>Williams, the Academy’s Curator of Invertebrate Zoology and Geology, encountered the sea fan now named <i>Chromoplexaura marki </i>during a two-week survey of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, and it was far from the only surprise. Funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the expedition team uncovered “rich and abundant habitats never seen before” in the area, prompting Williams to recommend that NOAA expand the existing sanctuary. The proposed expansion—roughly 2,000 additional square miles—would encompass the largest upwelling site in North America, better protecting the nutrient-rich waters that support everything from reefs and seabird colonies to endangered whales.    </p><p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><b>A walk on the ocean floor</b><br><br>That was not the only new discovery found in the ocean this year.  Scientists at the Academy dove into their field collections to discover 24 other new species that live in the world’s oceans.  Along with the sea fan, researchers discovered three new species of worm eels, three colorful gobies, three nudibranchs, two snappers, two now-extinct species of sand dollars, corals, barnacles, and two new sharks. </p><p><br><i>Hemiscyllium halmahera</i>, a new species of bamboo shark from Indonesia, was described by Academy research associate Mark Erdmann.  This small shark can fit in the palm of your hand and is recognized by interesting clusters of brown or white spots in polygon configurations all over its body.  The color pattern it displays is a perfect camouflage that helps the animal blend into its habitat on the bottom of the sea.  This bamboo shark, like a similar species on display at the Academy’s Steinhart Aquarium, uses its pectoral fins to "walk" along the ocean floor.  According to the paper published this year in the <i>International Journal of Ichthyology</i>, sharks of this genus are nocturnally active, bottom-living animals, which exhibit a peculiar "walking" gait while foraging for invertebrates and smaller fishes. Due to their reproductive mode, limited swimming ability, and poor dispersal capability most species have restricted distributions and are therefore often of conservation concern.   <br></p>

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (September 20, 2013) — The California Academy of Sciences has appointed Dr. Brian Fisher as the first Patterson Scholar in Science and Sustainability.  This endowed chair is named in honor of the late William J. Patterson, Chair of the Academy’s Board of Trustees from 2007 to 2010.  The first Patterson Scholar chair is made possible by a generous gift from Susan and Bill Oberndorf, and will be announced at the dedication of the new W.J. Patterson Plaza in front of the Academy on September 24.</p> <br><p>“Bill Patterson was passionate about the Academy and fascinated by the work of our scientists, who spend their lives exploring the diversity of life on Earth and the challenge of sustaining it,” said Dr. Greg Farrington, Executive Director of the Academy.  “To Bill, our scientist-educators are what make the Academy authentic and genuine.  Brian Fisher—an outstanding, extremely productive and charismatic researcher—exemplifies the best attributes of our scientific staff and is most deserving of being named the first Patterson Scholar.”</p> <br><p>Often found hip-deep in Madagascar mud, Brian Fisher has devoted his life to the study and conservation of ants and biodiversity. His research sends him to the last remote rainforests and deserts of Madagascar and Africa. Although Fisher’s subjects—ants—may be small in stature, they have a huge impact on their ecosystems. By documenting the species diversity and distribution of this “invisible majority,” Fisher is helping to establish conservation priorities for Madagascar, identifying areas that should be set aside to protect the highest number of species.</p>  <br><p>Fisher has also been exploring novel ways to streamline the process of capturing data and digitizing information and images about the natural world. His AntWeb database (<a href="http://www.antweb.org/" target="_blank">www.antweb.org</a>) is a definitive resource on the biodiversity of ants globally. He has also been instrumental in building scientific capacity in the developing world, training many Malagasy scientists both at the Academy and at the Academy’s biodiversity facility in Antananarivo, Madagascar. </p>  <br><p>Before his passing on September 24, 2010, Patterson spoke with Academy staff about his vision for an Academy that combines active science and education more effectively than any comparable institution in the world.  The Patterson Scholars in Science and Sustainability were created to help bring this vision to life.  Like Fisher, future Patterson Scholars will be scientist-educators of exceptional talent, achievement, and productivity who are committed to exploring the natural world, the challenge of sustainability, and science education through public engagement. </p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (April 10, 2013) – Today, biologists introduced a male penguin chick to the African penguin exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park. Hatched on January 28, 2013, the chick is just over two months old and, until today, has been living with his parents in a private nest off of public view to give the family a chance to bond. </p><br><p>African penguins were classified as an endangered species in 2010 and are at very high risk of extinction in the wild. The Academy’s African penguins are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Species Survival Plan (SSP), aimed at maintaining genetic diversity of captive populations through controlled breeding and collaborative exchange of offspring among partner zoos and aquariums. The Academy has a long and successful history of breeding African penguins as part of the SSP for this species, but this chick marks the first hatched at the new Academy building, which opened in late 2008. With the addition of its newest member, the colony is now at 16 happy, healthy birds. </p>  <br><p>The chick’s parents, Robben (father) and Ty (mother), are a recommended breeding pair due to their genetically valuable gene pools. Like all new parents, the pair have kept close watch over their new arrival, taking turns caring for the bird. On average, it takes one year for African penguins to lose their juvenile plumage and develop their tuxedo-like appearance. </p>  <br><p>The public can enter the Academy’s <a href="http://bit.ly/cas-penguin2" target="_blank" title="Name the Penguin Chick Contest">Name the Penguin Chick Contest</a>, which runs through April 30. Academy staff will select the top three names based on originality and connection to the Academy’s mission to explore, explain and sustain life, including the African penguin SSP program. The final three names will be put out to public vote, and the winning name will be announced during a naming ceremony in May. </p> <br><p>Visitors outside of the San Francisco Bay Area can view the new chick via the Academy’s online <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/webcams/penguins/" target="_blank" title="Penguin Cam">Penguin Cam</a> or by downloading the Pocket Penguins <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/apps/penguins/" target="_blank" title="Pocket Penguins app">mobile app</a>, where live feedings are broadcast daily at 10:30 am and 3:00 pm (PST).   </p>

			<div id="pr_header"><b>CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES TO PUBLICLY DISPLAY <br>RARE OCTOPUS SPECIES FOR THE FIRST TIME </b><p><i>The little-known Larger Pacific Striped Octopus is notable for its unusual mating habits and dramatic coloration </i></p>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">SAN FRANCISCO (March 5, 2013) – One of the world’s most beautiful—and little-known—species of octopus will go on public display for the first time tomorrow. Initially discovered in 1991 but largely forgotten until now, the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus is about to crawl into the spotlight in a new display at the California Academy of Sciences. Academy biologist Richard Ross, who studies octopuses and their relatives, has spent the last 13 months raising and studying the behavior of this recently rediscovered species, along with Dr. Roy Caldwell of the University of California, Berkeley. While they are still working on a formal description of the species, which doesn’t yet have a scientific name, they didn’t want to wait any longer to share this spectacular animal with the public.<br>&nbsp;<br>     “I’m thrilled that Academy visitors will have the opportunity to view this fascinating animal up close in the aquarium, where they’ll see just why its beauty, unique mating technique and social habits are intriguing the cephalopod community,” says Ross. <br>&nbsp;<br>      When it comes to mating and reproduction, the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus defies conventional octopus behavior in several surprising ways. Because female octopuses have a tendency to eat their mates, the animals usually live solitary lives—and when they do come together to mate, they typically try to stay as far away as possible from their mate’s mouth. However, pairs of Larger Pacific Striped Octopuses can live peacefully together in an aquarium, at times sharing a den, and they mate in an intimate beak-to-beak, or sucker-to-sucker, position. Additionally, unlike other octopus species in which the females tend to die after laying a clutch of eggs, these females can lay many clutches of eggs over the course of their lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>     This behavior has earned the animals a spot in the Academy’s <i>Animal Attraction</i> aquarium gallery, which highlights the remarkable and sometimes surprising techniques animals have developed for producing offspring and attracting mates. The Academy will initially display one female in the gallery, adding a male soon after. The display is accompanied by an iPad exhibit label featuring video footage of their mating behavior. Based on his observations to date, Ross expects that the male and female will live together without undue aggression, mating often. He plans to raise and study the paralarvae they produce to learn more about the animal’s life cycle and develop captive breeding protocols for the species, which is currently known from only a few locations off the coast of Nicaragua.<br>&nbsp;<br>   In addition to its surprising mating tactics, the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus is also remarkable for its dramatic coloration, which can switch from a dark reddish hue to black with white stripes and spots in fluid waves. The octopus can also assume different shapes, both flat and expanded.  <br>&nbsp;<br>   In the wild, the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus is thought to live in groups of up to 40 or more individuals. To monitor the behavior and development of the octopuses in captivity, Ross will first display one male and one female, then introduce other octopuses of varying sex to the tank to observe group dynamics, reproductive patterns and territorial behaviors. He will conduct regular work sessions to study their eating patterns, ability to understand enrichment activities, nesting habits and color patterns in relation to social interaction.

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body">SAN FRANCISCO (February 26, 2014) — Before your eyes, thousands of tiny flesh-eating beetle larvae wipe a skull clean, feasting on the meat of a dead animal’s head. An Academy anthropologist points to the eye sockets of an ancient skull and through them gazes 3.3 million years into the past. Two deer skulls seem to be staring at one another, antlers still locked in their final deadly battle. And video projections of swimming sea lions add life to a wall of more than 400 sea lion skulls arranged in an artistic 90-foot-long display. Some may find the idea macabre, but over one million wide-eyed visitors are about to have their minds expanded looking at skulls in a whole new light. <br><br>On May 16, 2014, the California Academy of Sciences will open the doors to <i>Skulls</i>, a new exhibit featuring 640 different dead heads. Skulls on display will range from an enormous African bull elephant to a tiny shrew, from frogs, fish, and birds to giraffes, warthogs, and walruses. <br><br>“A skull provides important information about a species’ evolution—and it also reveals secrets about that individual animal’s life,” says Moe Flannery, Collections Manager of Ornithology &amp; Mammalogy at the Academy. “By searching for clues written into the bone, we can follow the story of an animal’s life, from birth to old age. We can learn what the animal ate, how it defended itself, communicated, interacted with its environment, and often how it died—all by looking at its skull.” <br><br>Located in the Academy’s second floor Forum Theater and Gallery, the nearly 4,000-square-foot <i>Skulls</i> exhibit will run through November 30, 2014, allowing visitors to join the scientific quest to understand how vertebrate animals live, die, and—ultimately— evolve by studying their skulls. <br><br>“When people see a skull, their first thought is often about death,” says Scott Moran, Director of Exhibits at the Academy. "But the skulls in this exhibit really tell a story about life. They help us understand the living world. Here at the Academy, we house an amazing collection of more than 28 million scientific specimens from around the world, and this exhibit allows us to put hundreds of them on display, giving visitors the opportunity to investigate, discover, and wonder at some of our most fascinating biological treasures." <br><br><b><br>AN ELEPHANTINE ENTRANCE </b><br>Upon entering the exhibit, guests will come face to face with a massive African bull elephant skull. This huge skull belonged to a member of the largest living species of land mammal, yet honeycomb-like spaces in the bones of its forehead make it relatively lightweight, a feature that allowed the animal to hold its enormous head up more easily. Elephants have evolved many unique physiological features that we can learn about by studying their skulls. Through this impressive example, as well as displays of other skulls from a variety of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, visitors learn how scientists study the size, shape, position and structures of skulls to solve mysteries about an animal’s life. <br><br><b><br>A SEA OF SEA LIONS </b><br>Across a 90-foot-long wall of the exhibit, more than 400 California sea lion skulls stare down upon visitors, while projections of swimming sea lions add life and motion to the artistic design. Impressive as this undulating display is, it represents only about a sixth of the Academy’s collection of California sea lion skulls. This collection—the largest in the world—is enormously valuable because it allows scientists to study the health and status of California sea lion populations over time. Researchers from around the world have visited the Academy’s collection of California sea lion skulls to measure the impacts of environmental pollutants, study the spread of diseases, and assess other threats faced by the species.  <br><br>To encourage visitors to look more closely at these skulls, a few imposters—including a walrus, wolf, and warthog—are sprinkled among this sea of sea lions. At the “Where’s Walrus?” station, animal sounds provide clues to help visitors find the skulls that don’t belong. Touchable sea lion skulls are also positioned low enough for guests of all ages to feel and examine at eye-level. <br><br>A short video within this section of the exhibit tells the story of Academy Field Associate Ray Bandar, who personally collected, cleaned and prepared most the skulls on display. A retired high school biology teacher, Bandar collected his first skull in 1953 and has been at it ever since, under the permit of the California Academy of Sciences. Over the past 60 years, he has collected more than 7,000 skulls, including most of the Academy’s collection of about 2,500 California sea lions. Bandar’s amazing story and his contribution to the Academy’s specimen collection take center stage in the new <i>Skulls</i> exhibit. <br><br><b><br>FLESH-EATING BEETLES </b><br>Before a skull is accessioned into a scientific collection, the flesh must be cleaned off the bone. This can be done by burying the bone in the ground or soaking it in water—a slow process that can take weeks or even months. Scientists at the Academy also use dermestid beetle larvae to quickly (and safely) clean delicate bones. Guests will be able to watch these larvae in action as they diligently devour and clean the dried flesh from animal bones. When these carnivorous beetle larvae are most active—in a dark, warm environment with plenty to eat—they can scour the flesh from a small skull in just three days. <br><b><br><br>HANDS-ON SCIENCE </b><br>The Academy designed the new <i>Skulls</i> exhibit to be an interactive experience. Displays encourage guests to touch, feel, draw, play with, and explore the science of skulls. One interactive station allows guests to touch cast skulls of a human, a dolphin, and a horse. These skulls highlight the differences, but also the similarities, between vertebrate species. At another station, guests can learn about the evolutionary benefits behind a variety of unique skull shapes and adaptations. Interactive animations on the wall above illustrate the animal behaviors made possible by these bones. 	<br><br>Another popular interactive station—the Predator and Prey vision simulator—allows visitors to look through a viewer to see like a lion, and then flip a lever to see the same scene through the eyes of an antelope.  This simulation reveals the trade-offs between excellent depth perception and excellent peripheral vision. <br><br>"So often museums are trapped in glass cases. The Academy is not like that at all,” says Greg Farrington, the Executive Director of the California Academy of Sciences. “The <i>Skulls</i> exhibit is real. It’s very hands-on. Guests of all ages get to literally explore skulls, to hold them in their hands. And they’ll leave knowing a lot more about the natural world—as well as their own place in it.”

			<div id="pr_header"><b>NEW APPROACH TO TREATING VENOMOUS SNAKEBITES <br>COULD REDUCE GLOBAL FATALITIES<br></b><p><i>Needle-free treatment counteracts paralysis in minutes</i></p>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (July 30, 2013) – A team of researchers led by Dr. Matt Lewin of the California Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with the Department of Anesthesia at the University of California, San Francisco, has pioneered a novel approach to treating venomous snakebites—administering antiparalytics topically via a nasal spray. This new, needle-free treatment may dramatically reduce the number of global snakebite fatalities, currently estimated to be as high as 125,000 per year. The team demonstrated the success of the new treatment during a recent experiment conducted at UCSF; their results have been published in the medical journal <i>Clinical Case Reports.</i> </p><br><p>Snakebite is one of the most neglected of tropical diseases—the number of fatalities is comparable to that of AIDS in some developing countries. It has been estimated that 75% of snakebite victims who die do so before they ever reach the hospital, predominantly because there is no easy way to treat them in the field. Antivenoms provide an imperfect solution for a number of reasons—even if the snake has been identified and the corresponding antivenom exists, venomous bites often occur in remote locations far from population centers, and antivenoms are expensive, require refrigeration, and demand significant expertise to administer and manage. </p>  <br><p> “In addition to being an occupational hazard for field scientists, snakebite is a leading cause of accidental death in the developing world, especially among otherwise healthy young people,” says Lewin, the Director of the Center for Exploration and Travel Health at the California Academy of Sciences. “We are trying to change the way people think about this ancient scourge and persistent modern tragedy by developing an inexpensive, heat-stable, easy-to-use treatment that will at least buy people enough time to get to the hospital for further treatment.” </p>  <br><p>In his role as Director of the Academy’s Center for Exploration and Travel Health, Lewin prepares field medicine kits for the museum’s scientific expeditions around the world and often accompanies scientists as the expedition doctor. In 2011, Lewin put together snakebite treatment kits for the Academy’s Hearst Philippine Biodiversity Expedition, which would have required scientists to inject themselves if they needed treatment. When he saw their apprehension about the protocol, Lewin began to wonder if there might be an easier way to treat snakebite in the field. </p> <br><p>In some fatal snakebites, victims are paralyzed by the snake’s neurotoxins, resulting in death by respiratory failure. A group of common drugs called anticholinesterases have been used for decades to reverse chemically-induced paralysis in operating rooms and, in intravenous form, to treat snakebite when antivenoms are not available or not effective. However, it is difficult to administer intravenous drugs to treat snakebite outside of a hospital, so Lewin began to explore the idea of a different delivery vehicle for these antiparalytics—a nasal spray. </p> <br><p>In early April of 2013, Lewin and a team of anesthesiologists, led by Dr. Philip Bickler at UCSF Medical Center, designed and completed a complex experiment that took place at the medical center. During the experiment, a healthy human volunteer was paralyzed, while awake, using a toxin that mimics that of cobras and other snakes that disable their victims by paralysis. The experimental paralysis mimicked the effects of neurotoxic snakebite, progressing from eye muscle weakness all the way to respiratory difficulty, in the same order as is usually seen in envenomation. The team then administered the nasal spray and within 20 minutes the patient had recovered. The results of this experiment were published online in the medical journal, <i><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ccr3.3/full" target="_blank">Clinical Case Reports</a>.</i>  </p> <br><p>Later in April, Lewin delivered one of the keynote addresses, titled “How Expeditions Drive Clinical Research,” at the American Society for Clinical Investigation/Association of American Physicians joint meeting in Chicago, during which he talked about this experiment and its origins. As a result, he met Dr. Stephen Samuel, an Indian physician and scientist from Trinity College Dublin who was interested in collaborating in India, where an estimated 1 million people are bitten by snakes every year, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. Lewin flew to India to help Samuel set up treatment protocols at a rural hospital in Krishnagiri. </p> <br><p>In late June, Samuel, Dr. CS Soundara Raj and colleagues at TCR Multispeciality Hospital in Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu, India treated a snakebite victim using this method. The patient was suffering from persistent facial paralysis from a krait bite, despite having undergone a full course of antivenom treatment. Upon treatment with the antiparalytic nasal spray, the facial paralysis was reversed within 30 minutes. Two weeks after being treated, the patient reported having returned to her daily activities.  </p> <br><p>Lewin and his colleagues in the United States are now conducting additional studies on mice to develop new methods and drug combinations, as there are many combinations of anticholinesterases and anticholinergic agents that could be tried to make delivery of the drugs more predictable through the mucous membranes in the nose or eyes. He is also working to set up future clinical studies with Samuel, Soundara Raj and their colleagues in India. While there is much work in front of them, they have already taken important steps toward addressing a major global need. The entire team has embraced the TCR Multispeciality Hospital motto that “no patient should die from snakebite.” </p>

Meteor astronomer Dr. Peter Jenniskens kept a tally of finds and mobilized NASA Ames Research Center into leading the recovery effort from the air and the ground. 77 meteorites were found. Jenniskens will summarize research results reported in a recent 70-author Science article, and also discuss a second meteorite fall that happened in Novato and Sonoma on October 17 and was recovered, thanks to an ongoing allsky video surveillance of meteor showers in the Bay Area.

His <i>New York Times</i> best-selling book, <i>Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain</i>, explores the neuroscience of the conscious mind. His previous book, <i>Wednesday is Indigo Blue</i>, co-authored with Richard E. Cytowic, was an exploration of the neurological condition of synesthesia, in which the senses are blended. Eagleman directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action, as well as the Initiative on Neuroscience and Law at the Baylor College of Medicine. Kirsten “Dr. Kiki” Sanford is dedicated to making science accessible. She has produced and hosted programs featuring scientific luminaries such as James Watson, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Brian Green, Lisa Randall, Leonard Susskind, and Michio Kaku, among others. Eagleman is the 2013 Claire Matzger Lilienthal Distinguished Lecturer. <i>7:30 pm; Tickets are $22-27 for adults, $20-25 for Academy members. Price dependent on seating area.

A TOUR OF OUR INSIDES<br> Tuesday, April 16 at 7:00 pm<br> A special lecture featuring best-selling author Mary Roach  <br></b>Called “America’s funniest science writer” by the <i>Washington Post</i>, author Mary Roach takes us down the hatch on an unforgettable tour of our insides. The alimentary canal is classic Roach terrain: the questions inspired by our insides are as taboo, in their own way, as the cadavers in Stiff, and every bit as surreal as the universe of zero gravity explored in <i>Packing for Mars</i>. Why is crunchy food so appealing? Why is it so hard to find names for flavors and smells?  Why doesn’t the stomach digest itself?  How much can you eat before your stomach bursts? Can constipation kill you? Did it kill Elvis? We meet scientists who tackle the questions no one else thinks —or has the courage —to ask. And we go on location to a pet food taste-test lab, a bacteria transplant, and into a live stomach to observe the fate of a meal. Like all of Roach’s books, <i>GULP!</i> is as much about human beings as it is about human bodies. Roach is the author of four previous books, including <i>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</i>, and <i>Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void.</i>  <i>7:00 pm; Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for Academy members and seniors.

Platt, Professor and Director, Duke University Institute for Brain Sciences  <br><i>*This lecture takes place during NightLife and is 21+ only. </i><br></b> Innovation is critical for both individual and evolutionary success, but creative disruption requires taking risks. New research marrying the theory and methods of economics to cutting-edge neuroscience techniques—an emerging field known as neuroeconomics—is making new discoveries about the biological processes that motivate us to take risks and create new solutions to unforeseen challenges. Dr. Michael L. Platt will describe how the brain overcomes uncertainty to explore novel alternatives and create new knowledge. Parallel findings from humans, monkeys, rodents, and worms indicate that a common suite of underlying mechanisms has evolved to control the desire to explore. At one extreme, neuropsychiatric disorders like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and addiction, may arise from dysfunctional control of exploration. At the other, uniquely human faculties of creativity and technological innovation may reflect elaboration of this shared biological heritage controlling our desire to explore.  <i>7:30 pm; Tickets are $15 for adults, $12 for Academy and Leakey Foundation members and seniors.

A key component of this cosmological "standard model" is the theory of inflation, in which at ultra-early times the universe was expanding exponentially. Originally envisaged as an important but brief cosmological epoch, since inflation's invention, cosmologists have realized that in many cases inflation completely upends our picture of the ultra large-scale structure of the universe, and suggests that the universe lasts forever, may not have had a beginning, and has enormous size and complexity that is best described as a 'multiverse.' Dr. Aguirre will trace the development of these ideas, as well as look forward to prospects for testing or even confirming the idea of an infinite inflationary multiverse. <i>7:30 pm; Purchase tickets in advance online at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/lectures">www.calacademy.org/lectures</a>, or by calling (877) 227-1831.

Using a wide variety of works and visualizations drawing from both ancient and modern astronomy, Dr. Penprase presents a visual feast of astronomy, with constellation maps, aerial views of aligned celestial structures, and images of the universe as created by a wide range of cultures. Learn about the legends and sky watching practices that developed as ancient people took note of the motions of the sun and moon across the sky and on the horizon. From there, Dr. Penprase will provide an overview of constellations from the perspective of a wide variety of cultures, including the ancient Chinese, Egyptian, Hawaiian, Native American Chumash and Navajo tribes, the Inuit culture, and will also cover the Southern skies, such as the Aboriginal Australians and the Incan cultures. The wide variety of descriptions of the early universe, the structure of the physical universe from ancient Greek, Egyptian, Chinese, Babylonian, Mayan and other cultures are explained and illustrated with original art. This lecture will provide a unique wide angle lens to the many ways that society understands and describes the stars, and in the process, explores how that process reveals universal qualities of humankind. <i> 7:30 pm; tickets are $12 per person, $10 for seniors and $8 for Academy members.

The film will feature the story of scientists and citizens alike who have worked tirelessly to understand the ecology of Tahoe and preserve the beauty and functional ecosystem while maintaining a recreational treasure for years to come. Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in North America, located in the Sierra Mountains at the border of California and Nevada. With a depth of 1,645 feet, it is the second deepest lake in the United States. The lake was formed about 2 million years ago and is a part of the Lake Tahoe Basin with the modern lake being shaped during the ice ages. It is known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides. The post-World War II population, building boom and completion of the interstate highway links for the 1960 Winter Olympics held at Squaw Valley, resulted in a dramatic increase in development within the basin. From 1960 to 1980, the permanent residential population increased from about 10,000 to greater than 50,000, and the summer population grew from about 10,000 to about 90,000. The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Their efforts combined with other agencies and scientists from UC Davis has helped slow the degradation of the Lake in recent years and may now even be leading to a reversal of the damage caused by the development of past decades.  <i>This is a free event held at the SF Public Library Main Branch, 100 Larkin Street, San Francisco.

But in doing so they have found that almost all of the observable Universe is made of unknown materials. Dark energy, evidently a property of the vacuum, constitutes 68 percent of the matter/energy in the Universe. Dark matter, which interacts gravitationally with normal matter but is otherwise invisible, accounts for another 27 percent. Everything humans have previously observed—all the stars, planets, and nebulae—weighs in at less than 5 percent. And that's just the observable Universe! There's lots more, perhaps an infinite amount, beyond. This talk surveys what is currently known about the Universe, then presents a new way of looking at nature that goes beyond classical science to offer a glimpse of how the cosmos may be investigated in the near future.

His research helped uncover the neural basis for emotions and has shown that they play a central role in social cognition and decision-making. Since antiquity, artists and philosophers have sought to explain how we perceive, interpret, and shape our existence. Recent advances in brain imaging and fresh insights into the functioning of the human brain at the level of systems, cells and molecules, now provide opportunities for uncovering the neurological basis for a large array of mental functions from emotion and decision-making to the creativity expressed in the arts, sciences and technology. Antonio Damasio will be in conversation with Amy Standen from KQED Science, an award-winning multimedia science and environment series. Her work has been recognized by the National Association of Public Radio News Directors and Northern California's Society of Professional Journalists. Standen has been a producer on Pulse of the Planet, editor of Terrain Magazine, an editor at Salon and a roving reporter for KALW's Philosophy Talk. <i><b>Tickets:</b> $27 per person, $25 for Academy members.

Laura Carstensen is the founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity and a noted expert on socioemotional selectivity theory, a life-span theory of motivation. She explains, “Life expectancy is ballooning just as science and technology is on the cusp of solving many of the practical problems of aging. What if we could not only have added years but spend them being physically fit, mentally sharp, functionally independent, and financially secure? At that point, we no longer have a story about old age; we have a story about long life.” Carstensen studies the nature and development of the human life span looking for innovative ways to use science and technology to improve the well-being of people of all ages. She is a Stanford professor in Public Policy and professor of Psychology. Laura Carstensen will be in conversation with Roy Eisenhardt, a current professor at UC Berkeley’s Boalt Hall School of Law and former Executive Director of the California Academy of Sciences.

In the four years since, a flood of photometric data on upwards of 190,000 stars of unprecedented precision and continuity has provoked a watershed of more than 132 confirmed or validated planets, over 2,700 planetary candidates and a resounding revolution in our understanding of the behavior of stars. Recent discoveries include Kepler-62 with five planets, a total of which two are in the habitable zone, and are 1.4 and 1.7 times the radius of the Earth. Dr. Jenkins will highlight key scientific results from Kepler, and will also discuss the daunting challenges that faced the technical and scientific team as they designed, built and are now operating this amazing observatory. He will also give a brief overview of TESS, NASA’s next mission to detect Earth’s closest cousins.  <i>7:30 pm; Purchase tickets in advance online at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/lectures">www.calacademy.org/lectures</a>, or by calling (877) 227-1831.

Schulz will take you on a tour of his conservation work by being the first to ever utilize the Academy’s all-digital planetarium dome for a Pritzker member lecture, while discussing how polar bears, walruses, and other marine species depend on the arctic ice for feeding, resting, and denning. Conservation photography is a powerful tool for digital storytelling and this presentation is sure to inform and inspire. We will get a glimpse into the complexity of life in this challenging climate, as well as a better understanding of how life here is inevitably linked to life in the arctic. Schulz is a fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers (iLCP) and one of the world’s most acclaimed nature photographers.

In contrast to Noam Chomsky and other leaders in the field of linguistics, Dr. Boroditsky is often called a neo-Whorfian for her embrace of Benjamin Whorf’s and Edward Sapir’s theories that language is integral to the formation of ideas and the evolution of culture. The connection between words and thoughts has long captivated poets, philosophers and other thinkers. Dr. Boroditsky applies extensive scientific research to this relationship, supporting the notion that our cognitive process is fundamentally affected by the structure of language. She will be in conversation with Roy Eisenhardt, a Bay Area lawyer who has taught at UC Berkeley’s Boalt Hall School of Law and previously served as the executive director of the California Academy of Sciences. His numerous interviews for City Arts &amp; Lectures include Stephen King, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Desmond Tutu and David Remnick. <i>7:30 pm; Tickets are $22-27 for adults, $20-25 for Academy members.

The majority of these so-called exoplanets have not actually been "seen" but rather inferred from their effect on the host star. Through painstaking technical methods and tremendous telescope time, a handful can be directly imaged and these giant planets show fascinating diversity in their sizes, temperatures, weather, and relationships to their parent Suns. Over the past several years—and rather serendipitously—an entirely new and mysterious breed of "planets" has emerged. Astronomers have discovered a collection of orphans: planets that are moving through the Galaxy seemingly unattached to a star. These so-called free-floating planets are abundant in the Galaxy and vastly easier to study since we do not need to block the light of the exponentially brighter companion in order to get to the precious exoplanet data. In this talk, Faherty will highlight how we discovered these seemingly impossible objects and review how these strange, exotic planets may be key players in our understanding of planet formation and evolution.Tickets: $12 per person, $10 for seniors, $8 for Academy members. Seating is limited and advanced ticketing is required. To purchase tickets: www.calacademy.org/lectures or (877) 227-1831.

A PLAN FOR THE PLANETNathan Wolfe in Conversation with Shannon BennettTuesday, March 11 at 7:30 pm | Nourse TheatreArmed with high-tech tools and a small army of fieldworkers, Nathan Wolfe hopes to re-invent pandemic control and reveal hidden secrets of the planet's dominant lifeform: the virus. Wolfe has spent his life studying deadly viruses to detect worldwide disease pandemics before they kill millions. He is founder and executive chairman of Global Viral, a non-profit organization promoting the understanding, exploration and stewardship of the microbial world. Wolfe’s endeavors coordinate over one hundred scientists and staff around the planet by spotting viruses as soon as they surface through collecting and cataloguing blood samples, surveying wild animals, scanning urban blood banks and documenting the transfer and distribution of disease. Wolfe will be in conversation with Shannon Bennett, who is the Academy’s first ever Associate Curator of Microbiology. In this new position, she broadens the Academy’s research scope to include a dedicated focus on viruses and bacteria. Her specialty lies in infectious diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Tickets: $27 per person, $25 for Academy members.

In this compelling look at the natural world, National Geographic photographer David Liittschwager has traveled to different habitats across the planet, all of them rich with a diversity of plants and animals, to take a look at the riotous life contained in one cubic foot. In each location, Liittschwager sets down a metal cube that frames the space then, working with local scientists, he records what moves through the cube’s habitat over the course of a normal day and night. Next, he photographs the cube setting and begins individual portraits of its plant life and its flying, creeping, crawling creatures…anything visible to the naked eye, no matter how small. From the tropical waters off Moorea, French Polynesia to the coastal belt of the South African cape, Liittschwager captures the stunning diversity of life on Earth. In all, he covers six habitats, each introduced by an eyewitness essay that celebrates and explains its uniqueness.

Each fall, thousands of gray whales migrate from their summer feeding grounds around Alaska down to the waters of Baja California where they breed and calf. In the spring, the whales and their calves migrate back up North for the Summer. Their migration pathway follows closely along the California coast, providing us with outstanding opportunities for coastal whale watching as they pass through the waters of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. Each year approximately 15,000 of an estimated total population of 17,500 gray whales swim south along this migration path as they travel from Arctic feeding grounds in the north, en route to their Baja California breeding and calving grounds. Gray whales can be observed just a few miles off California's shore, providing us a perfect viewing opportunity for this incredible "parade."

The majority of these so-called exoplanets have not actually been "seen" but rather inferred from their effect on the host star. Through painstaking technical methods and tremendous telescope time, a handful can be directly imaged and these giant planets show fascinating diversity in their sizes, temperatures, weather, and relationships to their parent Suns. Over the past several years—and rather serendipitously—an entirely new and mysterious breed of "planets" has emerged. Astronomers have discovered a collection of orphans: planets that are moving through the Galaxy seemingly unattached to a star. These so-called free-floating planets are abundant in the Galaxy and vastly easier to study since we do not need to block the light of the exponentially brighter companion in order to get to the precious exoplanet data. In this talk, Faherty will highlight how we discovered these seemingly impossible objects and review how these strange, exotic planets may be key players in our understanding of planet formation and evolution.<br><b>Tickets:</b> $12 per person, $10 for seniors, $8 for Academy members.

Wolfe has spent his life studying deadly viruses to detect worldwide disease pandemics before they kill millions. He is founder and executive chairman of Global Viral, a non-profit organization promoting the understanding, exploration and stewardship of the microbial world. Wolfe’s endeavors coordinate over one hundred scientists and staff around the planet by spotting viruses as soon as they surface through collecting and cataloguing blood samples, surveying wild animals, scanning urban blood banks and documenting the transfer and distribution of disease. Wolfe will be in conversation with Shannon Bennett, who is the Academy’s first ever Associate Curator of Microbiology. In this new position, she broadens the Academy’s research scope to include a dedicated focus on viruses and bacteria.

In this compelling look at the natural world, National Geographic photographer David Liittschwager has traveled to different habitats across the planet, all of them rich with a diversity of plants and animals, to take a look at the riotous life contained in one cubic foot. In each location, Liittschwager sets down a metal cube that frames the space then, working with local scientists, he records what moves through the cube’s habitat over the course of a normal day and night. Next, he photographs the cube setting and begins individual portraits of its plant life and its flying, creeping, crawling creatures…anything visible to the naked eye, no matter how small. From the tropical waters off Moorea, French Polynesia to the coastal belt of the South African cape, Liittschwager captures the stunning diversity of life on Earth.

Since Save the Elephants (STE) was founded in 1993, its programs have expanded across the African continent to protect and study elephants in varying ecosystems—from the desert regions of Mali, to the forests of Gabon and Congo, to the savannahs of South Africa. Dr. Douglas-Hamilton applies cutting-edge research to the implementation of lasting conservation solutions. Through the use of GPS collars, STE researchers are able to receive live information on the movement of individual elephants, providing researchers with valuable clues as to elephant motivation. It also helps Douglas-Hamilton understand why elephants leave protected areas, where they go, and why they sometimes raid crop supplies. This information is used to develop wise land-use plans that establish protected corridors for elephants and minimize conflict with surrounding communities. STE is the leader in the pursuit of high-tech conservation solutions, which are combined with grassroots knowledge to secure a future for Africa's elephants and leverages technology to help people understand how they can live together with the wildlife of the land.  <i>7:00 pm; Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for seniors and free for Academy members.

In addition to their intrinsic scientific importance, these ideas also have far reaching implications for other aspects of our lives (e.g., philosophical, religious, and political). In this talk, Quataert will provide an overview of the modern understanding of origins in astrophysics, from the big bang to the discovery of planets around other stars. The story begins in the infant universe, which we now know was remarkably smooth compared to what we see around us today, with only tiny differences in its properties from one part to another. By contrast, in the present universe there are enormous differences in the properties of matter from one part to another: some regions host planets, stars, and galaxies (and even humans!) while others do not. Quataert will describe how the universe evolved from its smooth beginnings to its current state, emphasizing how gravity reigns supreme and builds up the planets, stars, and galaxies required for biological evolution to proceed.<i> 7:30 pm; tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for seniors, $8 for Academy members.

This class is designed as an overview to help you better understand your camera, the digital workflow and how to make better images. We cover basic features of the DSLR camera to include choosing lenses and filters, ISO, white balance, shutter, aperture and program modes, EV, exposure, bracketing, focusing, resolution, histograms and more. The main objective is to help you understand the fundamentals of exposure so that you can get your camera out of auto mode and start making images the way you want them to look. After reviewing the skills required to get the correct exposure under any conditions, we can shift our efforts to proper techniques for focus, light metering, depth of field and some basic rules of composition.<i> Please enter through the Academy's business entrance located at 75 Nancy Pelosi Drive.

She has inspired him to venture into the field, often taking his daughter with him, to move beyond childlike fascination and make those creatures feel more real. <i>Wild Ones </i>is a tour through our environmental moment and the eccentric cultural history of people and wild animals in America that inflects it—from Thomas Jefferson’s celebrations of early abundance, to the turn-of the-last-century origins of the teddy bear, to the whale-loving hippies of the 1970s. In America, <i>Wild Ones</i> discovers, wildlife has always inhabited the terrain of our imagination as much as the actual land. The journey is framed by the stories of three species: the polar bear, ogled by tourists outside a remote northern town; the little-known Lange’s metalmark butterfly, foundering on a small patch of industrialized land near San Francisco; and the whooping crane as it is led on a months-long migration by costumed men in ultralight airplanes. The wilderness that Wild Ones navigates is a scrappy, disorderly place where amateur conservationists do grueling, sometimes preposterous-looking work; where a marketer maneuvers to control the polar bear’s image while, at the same time, Martha Stewart turns up to film those beasts for her show on the Hallmark Channel. Our most comforting ideas about nature unravel and, in their place, Mooallem forges a new and affirming vision of the human animal and the wild ones as kindred creatures on an imperfect planet. <i>Wild Ones</i> merges reportage, science and history into a humane and endearing meditation on what it means to live in and bring a life into today’s world. Amy Standen is a producer for KQED Science. Book signing to follow. <i>This is a free event held at the Koret Auditorium at the SF Public Library Main Branch, 100 Larkin Street, San Francisco. Seating is limited. To reserve a space in advance, call (877) 227-1831 Online reservations are not available. </i></p>

Hirsh, Vermilion Sea Institute and University of Colorado, Boulder</b> <b><br>Tuesday, October 1 at 6:00 pm</b><br> When biologist Aaron Hirsh leads 12 college students to a remote fishing village on the Sea of Cortez, they come upon a bay of dazzling beauty and richness. As the group pursues various threads of investigation—ecological and evolutionary studies of the sea, the desert, and their various species of animals and plants; the stories of local villagers; the journals of conquistadors and explorers—they recognize that the bay has changed significantly through the years. Life in the Sea of Cortez has been reshaped by complex human ideas and decisions—the laws and economics of fishing, property, and water; the fantasies of tourists seeking the wild; even efforts to retrieve species from the brink of extinction. After weathering a hurricane and encountering a rare whale in its wake, they come to see that the bay’s best chance of recovery may in fact reside in our own human stories, which can weave a compelling memory of the place. Glimpsing the intricate and ever-shifting web of human connections with the Sea of Cortez, the students comprehend anew their own place in the natural world—suspended between past and future. They come to recognize their roles in the path ahead, and ultimately come to see one another, and themselves, in a new light. In <i>Telling Our Way to the Sea</i>, Hirsh’s voice resounds with compassionate humanity, capturing the complex beauty of both the marine world he explores and the people he explores it with. His story is a profound meditation on our changing relationships with nature and with one another. Book signing to follow.  <i>This is a free event held at the San Francisco Public Library Main Branch, 100 Larkin Street, San Francisco. Seating is limited and advanced ticketing is encouraged.

The Farallon Islands, just 27 miles off the coast of San Francisco, lie amid the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, a food-rich marine ecosystem that attracts whales, dolphins, seals and seabirds each summer and fall, to feed and to breed. Researchers have cataloged hundreds of individual humpbacks and blue whales as seasonal feeding residents. Twenty-three species of marine mammals, including eighteen species of whales and dolphins, can be found here. The Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge is the largest seabird rookery in the contiguous United States with nesting Tufted Puffins, Pigeon Guillemots, Rhinoceros Auklets, Common Murres and other species. Migratory seabirds such as Shearwaters, Jaegers, and Phalaropes are also attracted by these nutrient-rich waters.  Island beaches are covered with sea lions, including massive Steller's sea lions, now an endangered species. <i> Tickets are $175 per person, $150 for Academy members.

A one-man performance with dramatic supporting music and full dome visuals, the Morrison Planetarium in collaboration with Motion Institute presents The Kepler Story, an innovative, immersive performance piece about the life of 17th century astronomer and mystic Johannes Kepler. The story of his life, including his discovery of the three laws of planetary motion which removed Earth once and for all from its position at the center of the Universe, took an even more dramatic turn when his mother was arrested for witchcraft and Kepler was forced to defend her. On the way to her trial, reading Galileo’s father’s book on harmony, Kepler experienced one of his greatest epiphanies about the harmony of the Universe. <i>Tickets are $15 per person, $12 for Academy members.

Their study is multinational and multigenerational; anyone with curiosity may make an enduring discovery.  At scales of resolution ranging from molecular to global, collections provide hard data to model the past, present and future of life.  Collections also present objects and patterns of sublime beauty to please and inspire.  Since the Gold Rush, the California Academy of Sciences has been at the forefront of efforts to build and use collections to explore, explain and sustain life on our planet. Charles Griswold, the Academy's spider expert, will lead a virtual tour of the how, what, where and why scientists collect and what it reveals to us about life on Earth of the past, present and future. <i>7:00 pm; tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for seniors, free for Academy members.

Cabrol, Planetary Scientist at the Carl Sagan Center, SETI Institute</i><br></b> The last decade has seen a revolution in astrobiology—the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. Results returned by planetary missions in the solar system such as Messenger, Venus Express, the Mars Exploration Rovers, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Express, MSL and the Curiosity Rover, Cassini, and Kepler, as well as multi-disciplinary research in terrestrial extreme environments have resulted in a new, inclusive, vision of astrobiology. What we learn from one planet helps us understand others, including our own, and guides the design and planning of future astrobiology-focused missions. In her presentation, Dr. Cabrol will discuss this revolution in astrobiology, with the latest updates from these various missions, and where we stand on our quest to understanding habitability and finding life beyond Earth. <i>Tickets are $12 per person, $10 for seniors and $8 for Academy members.

On February 15, 2013, a rocky projectile entered the Earth’s atmosphere traveling at more than 11 miles per second. It was about 65 feet in diameter, or half the diameter of the famous Tunguska impact of 1908, which flattened a thousand square miles of Siberian forest. Its terminal explosion, at an altitude of 14 miles, released energy of about half a megaton, the equivalent to a couple dozen Hiroshima-sized atom bombs. About two minutes later, the shock wave reached the ground in Chelyabinsk, Russia, breaking windows and injuring about 1,500 people from flying glass. The Chelyabinsk impactor was smaller than most asteroids that have been detected by the telescopes of the NASA Spaceguard Survey, which focuses on finding asteroids of about 100 m or larger. Since it approached the Earth from very near the direction of the Sun, it could not have been seen by any ground-based optical telescope of any size. It therefore struck without warning. Has this event served as a sort of cosmic wake-up call for planetary defense? NASA scientist David Morrison will speak to us about how we survey space to try to determine when Earth will be impacted by a large space object, and what the potential implications could be for life on Earth. <i>7:30 pm; Purchase tickets in advance online at <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/lectures">www.calacademy.org/lectures</a>, or by calling (877) 227-1831.

Compared to moving slowly, the advantages seem obvious: find food first, forage more widely, and escape more rapidly! But, in the water, being speedier incurs huge energetic costs, with moving a little bit faster skyrocketing the amount of fuel you need. This trade-off between speed and energy propels the evolutionary race for fish, robots, or sailboats—you have to find ways to go faster with ever-greater efficiency. Over generations, the evolutionary race can produce biological and engineering surprises: distantly related fish and boat hulls that have similar streamlined shapes, materials and construction techniques that manage to both stiffen and lighten bodies and hulls, specialization of propulsive systems, and constraints on making turns and tight maneuvers. While the evolutionary processes employed by nature and engineers are similar, there are important differences in how fish or boats are built. For both kinds of designers, the laws of evolution and physics interact to create and constrain the drive for speed. Dr. Long will discuss how the Interdisciplinary Robotics Research Lab studies fast fish!

			<div id="pr_body"><p> SAN FRANCISCO (July 1, 2014)—On Friday, August 1, the California Academy of Sciences will open its first major photography exhibit <i>BigPicture</i>. Featuring the work of award-winning nature, wildlife, and conservation photographers from around the world, the exhibit will display winning images from the Academy’s inaugural BigPicture Natural World Photography Competition, using photography as a means to celebrate and illustrate the rich diversity of life on Earth and inspire action to protect and conserve it. The exhibit will be on display through November 2, 2014. </p><br><p>To view and download winning images for editorial use and learn more about the winning photographers, please contact <a href="mailto:press@calacademy.org">press@calacademy.org</a>. </p><br><p>Spotlighting the work of an international group of professional-level conservation photographers, the exhibit and preceding competition focus a visual lens on the Academy’s mission to explore, explain, and sustain life, raising one simple yet profound call to action: What on Earth have you photographed?  </p><br><p>Over 6,300 photographic submissions were received, which were reviewed by a judging panel of esteemed professional photographers and photo editors. The exhibit will feature 45 works from finalists representing 12 international countries. From the dueling moment of attack between a sparrowhawk and a Eurasian jay, to the majestic peaks of a swelling wave captured as solid as a snow-capped mountain, each image in the exhibit captures its own unique interpretation of the natural world through a photographic lens, resulting in a captivating display that gives visitors a bird’s-eye view into moments of life on our planet.  </p><br><p>The Grand Prize-winning image (pictured above), titled <i>The Luckiest Penguin</i>, was shot by Paul Souders of Seattle, Washington. An award-winning, professional photographer, Souders’ images have been featured in National Geographic, Time, and LIFE magazines. His impressive photographic work in the Arctic has won him numerous accolades, including first-place awards in BBC's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition (2011 and 2013), as well as National Geographic’s Photo of the Year (2013). His image captures the “fight or flight” moment of surprise for a Gentoo penguin, just narrowly escaping a leopard seal’s stealthy and well-orchestrated advance out of Antarctic waters.   </p><br><p>“Paul Souders’ image is packed with power, action, atmosphere, and brilliant behavior—a rare moment, marvelously captured and truly deserving of the competition’s highest honor,” says Suzi Eszterhas, award-winning wildlife photographer and Jury Chair. “The quality of images and talent of photographers entered into the competition during this inaugural year set a high standard for future years of BigPicture.” </p><br><p>First-place winners include: Emanuele Biggi (Land Mammals), Pål Hermansen (Birds), Paul Souders (Invertebrates, Reptiles, Marine Mammals, Fish, and Amphibians), Ray Collins (Landscapes, Waterscapes, and Plant Life), and Morgan Heim (Conservation Imagery). The Grand Prize winner and finalists will receive over $20,000 in cash prizes and photography equipment provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.borrowlenses.com/" target="_blank">BorrowLenses.com</a>. </p><br><p>Moving beyond a conventional photography display, perspectives from Academy scientists are woven into the exhibit’s design, offering scientific insight into the striking moments captured through photography and drawing connections between the power of imagery to inform conservation research happening around the world.  </p><br><p>“Visual storytelling is critical in explaining science and conservation issues to the public in a compelling and impactful way, particularly to children,” says Dr. Meg Lowman, the Academy’s Chief of Science and Sustainability. “Each of these photos tells an amazing story, and this exhibit is a striking example of how the Academy seeks to explain and educate our visitors about global sustainability issues through vivid, engaging exhibits.” </p><br><p>Competition judges include: Daniel Beltrá (Madrid, Spain), Klaus Nigge (Lünen, Germany), Thomas Peschak (Cape Town, South Africa), David Liittschwager (San Francisco, California), Clay Bolt (Easley, South Carolina), Tui De Roy (South Island, New Zealand), Ian Shive (Los Angeles, California), Kathy Moran (Washington D.C.), and Jury Chair Suzi Eszterhas (San Francisco, California).  </p><br><p>The winners of the competition will be honored at a special BigPicture NightLife event (21+) on Thursday, July 31 from 6-10 pm. Members of the press are invited to preview the exhibit before it opens to the public the following day and attend a special award ceremony hosted by BigPicture jurors Suzi Eszterhas and Ian Shive, both award-winning nature photographers, with a special introduction by Dr. Meg Lowman. In the planetarium, take a closer look at photography in the dome with photographer Art Wolfe during a special presentation at 6:30 pm.

			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 12, 2014) – The JRS Biodiversity Foundation today announced the five grant recipients from its January 2014 call for innovative grant proposals in the field of biodiversity informatics. These grants cover diverse approaches to collecting and creating access to biodiversity knowledge and underscore the foundation's commitment to advancing biodiversity informatics, investment in sub-Saharan Africa, and to capacity building to increase knowledge of biodiversity.</p><br><p>"Biodiversity data becomes valuable when it is accessible and in the hands of researchers and conservationists who can act upon the information,” says Don Doering, Executive Director of the JRS Biodiversity Foundation. “JRS supports this project due to the commitment of the California Academy of Sciences’ lead researcher David Blackburn, collaborator Aaron Bauer of Villanova University, and their partners, to train Angolan and Namibian scientists to identify and assess the conservation status of their own nations' amphibians and reptiles."</p><b><br></b><p><b>California Academy of Sciences - Digitizing Southwestern-African Herpetological Collections, $180,000</b></p><br><p>Angola and Namibia form a hotspot for reptile and amphibian biodiversity, however, decades of civil war and a lack of expertise in biodiversity informatics has made much of this data inaccessible. This means that much of the scientific collections that document the diversity and distribution of this unique fauna remain unknown. In partnership with African institutions, the project team will collaboratively digitize and geocode data from the principal herpetological collections for Angola and Namibia and distribute these globally under a Creative Commons license. In addition, amphibian and reptile specimens from Angola and Namibia in other collections in South Africa, Europe, and the United States will be geo-referenced. Generated data will be used to update conservation assessments for reptile and amphibian species, many of which have not yet been assessed or are currently assessed as Data Deficient. In?country training focused on database creation, maintenance, use, and downstream conservation applications to facilitate current priorities in these countries for biodiversity documentation.</p><br><p>"Funding from JRS will help us to get these historically important but digitally invisible scientific collections off the shelf and online,” says Dr. David Blackburn, Assistant Curator of Herpetology at the Academy. “Completing our knowledge of what species occurred where and when provides the baseline for future field studies, especially for beginning to understand how humanity's impact on the world has and continues to shape the biodiversity around us."</p><br><p>Additional grant recipients of the JRS Biodiversity Foundation award include the Institute of Ecology at National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the  University of Ghana, and the Wildlife Conservation Society.</p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 26, 2014) – Scientists from the California Academy of Sciences have discovered a new species of round-eared sengi, or elephant-shrew, in the remote deserts of southwestern Africa. This is the third new species of sengi to be discovered in the wild in the past decade. It is also the smallest known member of the 19 sengis in the order Macroscelidea. The team’s discovery and description of the Etendeka round-eared sengi <i>(Macroscelides micus)</i> is published this week in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asmjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1644/13-MAMM-A-159" target="_blank"><i>Journal of Mammalogy</i></a>.</p><br><p>While collecting and examining sengi specimens from southwestern Africa, Drs. Jack Dumbacher and Galen Rathbun encountered an unusual specimen collected in the remote northwestern region of Namibia that differed in appearance from any of the museum specimens that they had examined previously. The specimen was significantly smaller, had rust-colored fur, a large, hairless gland on the underside of its tail, and lacked dark skin pigment. Preliminary genetic analysis also showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives. </p><br><p>Suspecting they may have encountered a new species, the team—including research colleagues in Namibia, Timothy Osborne (California Academy of Sciences), Michael Griffin (Republic of Namibia Ministry of Environment and Tourism), and Seth Eiseb (National Museum of Namibia), all co-authors on the paper—set out on nine expeditions between 2005-2011. In total, the team collected 16 specimens for comparative analyses.  </p><br><p>Comparing the specimens to those in natural history collections in Windhoek, Pretoria, London, Los Angeles, and the Academy in San Francisco, and further genetic analysis, confirmed that they had, in fact, found a new species, demonstrating the critical role that scientific collections play in biodiversity studies.</p><br><p>“Had our colleagues not collected those first invaluable specimens, we would never have realized that this was in fact a new species, since the differences between this and all other known species are very subtle,” says Dumbacher, the Academy’s Curator of Ornithology and Mammalogy. “Several museum collections were instrumental in determining that what we had was truly new to science, highlighting the value of collections for this type of work. Genetically, <i>Macroscelides micus</i> is very different from other members of the genus and it’s exciting to think that there are still areas of the world where even the mammal fauna is unknown and waiting to be explored.”</p><br><p>Sengis are restricted to Africa and, despite their small size, are more closely related to elephants, sea cows, and aardvarks than they are to true shrews. Found in a remote area of Namibia, on the inland edge of the Namib Desert at the base of the Etendeka Plateau, scientists believe this new species went undescribed for so long because of the challenges of doing scientific research in such an isolated area. Yet it is precisely this isolation, and the unique environmental conditions in the region, that have given rise to this and other endemic organisms.</p><br><p>An Etendeka round-eared sengi specimen has been added to the Namib Desert diorama exhibit in the Academy’s African Hall, part of its natural history museum. It joins a replica of <i>Welwitschia mirabilis</i>, an ancient plant also endemic to the Namib Desert that may live for up to 2,500 years. The plant’s wide, drooping leaves provide important habitat for other endemic species, such as the black-and-yellow spotted firebug <i>(Probergrothius sexpunctatus)</i>. </p><br><p>“With only about a dozen new species of mammal discovered in the wild each year, it is amazing that the Academy has been involved in describing three new sengis in the last decade,” says Rathbun, an authority on the biology of sengis and an Academy Fellow and Research Associate.  “There are new and exciting insights into biodiversity awaiting discovery, even in a group as familiar as mammals.”</p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 4, 2014) — Scientists from the California Academy of Sciences return this week from the largest scientific diving expedition in the Academy’s 160-year history. Its focus: an intensive exploration of the Philippines’ Verde Island Passage, a region thought to be the "center of the center" of marine biodiversity.</p><br><p>“When we talk about biodiversity, we're really talking about species richness,” says Dr. Rich Mooi, Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the California Academy of Sciences and a Principle Investigator of the expedition. “Species richness is crucial to the healthy workings of an ecosystem, and by understanding the state of biodiversity in this place, at this time, we can work with our partners here in the Philippines to inform policy about the protection of these areas.” </p><br><p>Over the course of this seven-week undertaking, funded by the National Science Foundation, more than 50 scientists collected 400-plus marine species, including rare and new species of fish, invertebrates, plants, and coral. Focusing on three main areas of the Verde Island Passage—Mabini in the Province of Batangas, moving across Balayan Bay to Calatagan, and finishing in the waters around remote Lubang Island—scientific divers explored not just the areas traditionally open to scuba, but deep-water, “twilight zone” regions never before seen by human eyes. </p><br><p>“The twilight zone is a narrow band between 200 and 500 feet that's totally unexplored,” says Bart Shepherd, Director of the Academy’s Steinhart Aquarium. “It’s below the limits of normal scuba diving technology, but above where you would send an ROV or a submersible…. It’s the area of the ocean we know the least about. No human has ever been to these places—more people have been to the moon—and half of what we find when we go there is unknown to science.”</p><br><p>Reaching those kinds of depths requires Academy divers to push the boundaries of both technology and the human body, using closed-circuit “rebreathers” that extend the amount of time they can spend underwater. So much gas is absorbed by a diver’s tissues that the vast majority of every twilight zone dive must be spent in slow and careful decompression, but the scientific rewards are enormous. </p><br><p>"The rate of species [discovery] in the twilight zone has turned up as many as five or 10 new species per hour,” says Mooi. "The fish communities are different. The invertebrate communities are definitely different. That's true exploration!” </p><br><p>“We already know we've found dozens of new species,” says Dr. Terry Gosliner, Senior Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the California Academy of Sciences and a Principle Investigator of the expedition. “Every time we go in the water, even places we’ve been to many times, we continue to find new things.”</p><br><p>Academy researchers are joined on this multi-disciplinary undertaking by scientific colleagues from the Philippines, other U.S. research institutions, and by a team of Academy educators who are working to share the expedition’s findings with local community and conservation groups. </p><br><p>“The kind of work we're doing has never been more important,” says Gosliner, “because the world is changing so rapidly, we need all the eyes and ears that we can muster to really come up with effective management strategies. Scientists can no longer sit back and do science just for the sake of doing science. We have real-world problems here that need scientific guidance and expertise to make the changes that need to take place to preserve all of this, and to allow people to have enriching livelihoods and also feed their families. We’re optimistic. All of that is seemingly working right now, and it's very gratifying.”</p><br><p>Expedition discovery highlights thus far include a spectacular new species of <i>Grammatonotus</i> (a genus of splendid perch) and a beautiful <i>Synchiropus circularis</i>—a rare dragonet that had never previously been seen in the Verde Island Passage. Both were collected at 470 feet. Many new species of colorful sea slugs were also discovered, and an undescribed species of <i>Liopropoma</i> (basslet fish) collected at 350 feet is currently on its way back to Steinhart Aquarium. </p><br><p>These discoveries will be confirmed and described in the coming months as Academy scientists use DNA sequencing and other tools to analyze all specimens collected in the field, likely discovering even more new species in the process. Their work will be available for further study by the scientific community. In addition, the Academy hopes to display some of the Verde Island Passage species in Steinhart Aquarium to promote greater awareness and conservation efforts, and perhaps inspire the next generation of ocean explorers.</p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (April 28, 2014) – The California Academy of Sciences today announced the appointment of Jonathan Foley, Ph.D., as its new executive director. Following a comprehensive international search, the Academy's Board of Trustees selected Dr. Foley to lead the Academy’s efforts to explore and explain the natural world and address critical sustainability challenges. Foley is currently the director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota, where he is also a professor and McKnight Presidential Chair of Global Environment and Sustainability. He will begin his tenure at the Academy on August 18, 2014.  <br><br>"Through its innovative programs of scientific research, education and public engagement, the California Academy of Sciences is revolutionizing the way natural history museums address the global challenges of sustainability," said John C. Atwater, chair of The California Academy of Sciences Board of Trustees. "Dr. Foley is uniquely qualified to build on the Academy's proud legacy and successfully steer the institution during this exciting chapter in its 160-year history." <br><br>During his tenure at University of Minnesota’s Institute on the Environment, Foley and his colleagues made great contributions to our understanding of global food security, worldwide changes in ecosystems, land use and climate, and the sustainability of our planetary resources.  Foley’s work has focused on addressing the world’s biggest environmental challenges, and ensuring that science engages with decision makers and the broader public. As an example of his recent work, Foley’s landmark plan to address the challenges of feeding a growing global population while protecting our planet for this and future generations—which graces the cover of the May issue of <i>National Geographic</i>—offers both hope and a way forward, providing strategic solutions for increasing global food production while reducing agriculture’s environmental footprint. His work on global environmental issues and science communication also recently caught the attention of the Heinz Family Foundation, which named Foley the winner of the 2014 Heinz Award for the Environment. Because of this large body of work, Foley has become a trusted advisor to governments, environmental groups, foundations, media organizations, and business leaders around the world. <br><br>"Dr. Foley’s commitment to impacting our world through scientific research and public education coupled with his proven leadership record made him the ideal candidate to lead the Academy as it continues to expand its efforts to shape the science and issues that will determine our collective future," said Jerome C. Vascellaro, Academy trustee and chair of the California Academy of Sciences Executive Director Search Committee. "Dr. Foley brings a unique blend of scientific excellence, compelling public outreach, fundraising experience, and capacity for building partnerships to his role as executive director." <br><br>Before joining the University of Minnesota in 2008, Foley spent 15 years on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin, where he founded the Climate, People and Environment Program and the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment. He and his colleagues have published numerous scientific papers, including highly cited work in<i> Science</i>, <i>Nature</i> and the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. A noted science communicator committed to mentoring young scientists and bringing a message of possibility and change to scientific and lay audiences alike, Foley has also written many popular articles and essays, including pieces in <i>National Geographic</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Scientific American</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, and elsewhere. His presentations on global issues have been featured at hundreds of venues, including the Aspen Environmental Forum, the Chautauqua Institution and TED. <br><br>Foley has won numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (awarded by President Bill Clinton), the National Science Foundation's Faculty Early Career Development Award; the J.S. McDonnell Foundation's 21st Century Science Award; an Aldo Leopold Leadership Fellowship; the Sustainability Science Award from the Ecological Society of America; and the Heinz Award for the Environment.  <br><br>"I congratulate and welcome Dr. Foley as he takes the helm of the California Academy of Sciences, which is not only an educational destination in our City, but a leading research institution,” said San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee. “His proven experience in ecosystem science and sustainability, his international leadership, and his collaborative approach will be exceptional assets to the Academy and San Francisco." <br><br>“I am truly thrilled and honored to be asked to serve as the next executive director of the California Academy of Sciences.  I have long admired the Academy as a place that brilliantly connects science and society, and am excited to work with the whole Academy community to pursue the vital mission of exploring, explaining and sustaining life on Earth,” said Foley.  “As the world faces enormous sustainability challenges – to our ecosystems, our natural resources, and to our societies – the Academy stands as a compelling source of world-class education and engagement, cutting-edge scientific research, and unmatched inspiration.  I want to thank the Academy Trustees for this amazing opportunity, and Mayor Lee for his strong support.  I look forward to joining the Academy team this summer, and working with them in the years ahead.”  <br><br>Foley will succeed the Academy’s current executive director, Gregory Farrington, Ph.D., who announced his plans to retire in September of last year. Once Foley is on board, Farrington will begin serving as a global ambassador for the Academy, visiting major centers of sustainability research and education around the world to share Academy experiences and programs, explore best practices, and identify potential partners for the Academy’s global initiatives. <br><br>"I would also like to thank Dr. Farrington for his years of exceptional service,” adds Mayor Lee.  “He oversaw the Academy’s move into its new LEED Platinum home in Golden Gate Park, which combines a museum, aquarium, planetarium, and research and education institution and has attracted a record-breaking number of visitors."  <br><br><b>Editors, please note:</b> For high-resolution images or further information, please contact Stephanie Stone at (415) 379-5121 or <a href="mailto:sstone@calacademy.org">sstone@calacademy.org</a>.  </p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (April 25, 2014)—The California Academy of Sciences has acquired the crowd-sourcing scientific observation platform iNaturalist.org, an initiative that was announced at the Academy’s annual Big Bang Gala fundraiser last night.</p><br><p>iNaturalist.org is a social network and mobile application for sharing biodiversity observations, with a mission to connect people to nature through technology. Since its launch in 2008, the app has been accessed by more than 1.4 million visitors around the world, with a new observation recorded every 45 seconds. These observations, which include over 600,000 natural history sightings representing over 50,000 distinct species to date, are verified and referenced by researchers from around the world.</p> <br><p>“We are thrilled to embark on this new chapter with iNaturalist, a platform we believe perfectly complements the Academy’s mission to explore, explain, and sustain life,” says Meg Lowman, Ph.D., Chief of Science and Sustainability at the California Academy of Sciences. “Together, we are uniquely positioned to engage the public in citizen science through accessible research with real sustainability outcomes, whether out in the field or in K-12 classrooms around the world.”</p> <br><p>While this acquisition marks a new chapter in the Academy’s relationship with iNaturalist, the two organizations already have a strong track record of working together to achieve common goals. The Academy has utilized the iNaturalist platform in its citizen science initiatives since 2011, and iNaturalist co-directors Scott Loarie and Ken-ichi Ueda have used the Academy facility as a home base for over a year. </p> <br><p>Over the past few years, Academy educators and scientists, as well as youth involved in the museum’s education programs, have leveraged the iNaturalist platform to survey biodiversity in several local communities, including the Pillar Point intertidal zones, Mt. Tamalpais watershed, Crissy Field, and Golden Gate Park. Through this acquisition, the Academy plans to expand the reach of its citizen science efforts by integrating this platform into ongoing research activities, developing scientific visualizations to inspire public engagement, and allowing members of this online community to contribute to the scientific process in meaningful and measurable ways.</p> <br><p>“iNaturalist is on its way towards building a global community of millions of naturalist explorers,” says Scott Loarie, Ph.D., co-director of iNaturalist. “Through a world-class science institution like the Academy, we can ensure that the efforts of these naturalists genuinely make a difference—not only in understanding the diversity of life but also towards sustaining it through the unfolding extinction crisis.”</p> <br><p>In addition to its role in Academy research and education initiatives, iNaturalist is currently used by many other research and conservation organizations, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to document biodiversity through ongoing data collection projects. It enables users around the world to contribute research-quality data to both the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Encyclopedia of Life. Leveraging the Academy’s role as both a world-class scientific research institution and leader in environmental education, the museum plans to foster growth of the iNaturalist platform and social network and broaden its scope of use by students and educators across the globe. </p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 22, 2014) — Scientists from the California Academy of Sciences and more than 60 other international research institutions spanning six continents have responded to a recent paper in <i>Science</i>, which questioned current methods of scientific collecting and advocated the use of non-lethal alternatives. The response, led by Luiz Rocha, Ph.D., the Academy's Assistant Curator and Follett Chair of Ichthyology, and co-authored by such science luminaries as Harvard's E. O. Wilson and the Academy's Chief of Science and Sustainability, Margaret (Meg) Lowman, describes in detail the value that scientific collections provide across a wide range of disciplines, including conservation biology, and stresses the minimal impact that collecting has on populations. The response is published this week in <i>Science</i>.<br><br></p> <p>In the original paper, "Avoiding (Re)extinction," the authors (Minteer et al.) argued that the collection of scientific specimens has played a significant role in species extinction, pointing to examples of now-extinct birds, frogs, and plants to support this idea. In response, Rocha et al. present significant evidence to the contrary. For example, of the 102 great auk (<i>Pinguinus impennis</i>) specimens in scientific collections, many are skeletons collected after extinction—and even when added together, the total number of specimens is a tiny fraction of the estimated millions of great auks harvested for food, oil, and feathers. Similarly, there are only nine scientific specimens of the now-extinct Mexican elf owl (<i>Micrathene whitneyi graysoni</i>), and these were collected when, according to field records, the species was still common—before the effects of habitat degradation and invasive species had pushed the owls to extinction.<br><br></p> <p>“A few representatives taken for scientific collections is a drop in the bucket compared to the many other threats that species face today,” says Rocha. “Habitat degradation and loss, unsustainable harvesting, and invasive species each play much larger and more devastating roles in population decline and species extinction.” <br><br></p> <p>In their paper, Minteer et al. went on to recommend alternatives to standardized collection methods used today, namely photography, audio recordings, and non-lethal tissue collection. Although in some cases these methods are useful in species identification, Rocha et al. argue that they fall far short of the wealth of information that scientific specimens provide. Species identification, they write, is not the only—and is often not the most important—reason to collect voucher specimens.<br><br></p> <p>“Photographs and audio recordings can't tell you anything about such things as a species' diet, how and where it breeds, how quickly it grows, or its lifespan — information that's critical to assessing extinction risk, and vital IUCN Red List designation,” Rocha explained. “And because photos and sound recordings provide only snapshots of individuals at one time and place, they can't be used to understand how a species and its ecology, distribution, and population dynamics have changed over time, or how individuals vary from one part of the species' range to another.” <br><br></p> <p>In their response, Rocha et al. point to several examples that illustrate the role scientific collections have played in understanding such things as the effects of climate change on populations and the spread of disease. In one such analysis, scientists looked at specimens from a wide range of taxa, collected over the past several decades or more, and found a significant correlation between an increase in mean ambient temperatures and a decrease in body size—a response that might affect the ability of some species to tolerate more dramatic swings in temperature extremes.<br><br></p> <p>Scientists have also analyzed amphibian specimens collected over the past five decades or more, including many in the Academy's herpetology collections, to track the origin and spread of the deadly chytrid fungus in hopes of preventing its further spread. And this sort of disease tracking is not limited to chytrid. <br><br></p> <p>"There are a lot of diseases in many different species that we can better understand by tracking them through time, addressing questions about where the disease came from, what the pattern has been, and whether anything has fundamentally shifted in the environment,” says David Blackburn, Ph.D., Assistant Curator of Herpetology at the California Academy of Sciences. “But a snapshot from one time period won’t allow us to answer those questions; we only get that ability from looking at many historical records over time."<br><br></p> <p>In other cases, genetic data from decades-old scientific specimens has even been used to "de-extinct" species. One of these, the Vegas Valley leopard frog (<i>Rana fisheri</i>), was thought to have gone extinct in the wake of Las Vegas development. However, a study published in 2011 compared the genetics of specimens from the extinct population to individuals from surviving populations of similar-looking frogs elsewhere in the southwest and found them to be the same species.  These types of discoveries, the authors wrote, are "the hallmark of biological collections: They are often used in ways that the original collector never imagined." And with the continuing emergence of new technologies, this potential only grows. <br><br></p> <p>That potential, combined with the increasing number of threats species face and the need to understand them, suggests that the need to collect scientific specimens—and to share the information they hold—has never been greater. <br><br></p> <p>"We don't maintain collections for our own personal benefit," Blackburn emphasized. "We collect specimens and manage the collections we have as a resource for the community and the world. We are the stewards of this vital resource, and that means we should share them as widely and freely as possible."<br><br></p> <p>"I am delighted, but not surprised, at the outpouring of support from scientists around the world who recognize the importance of collections for both research and conservation,” says Meg Lowman, Ph.D., Chief of Science and Sustainability at the Academy. “The invaluable specimen collections held by institutions like the Academy provide one of our best tools for understanding and addressing the most pressing sustainability challenges of our time."</p>

			<div id="pr_header"><b>EXPERIMENTAL TRIAL REPRESENTS PROMISING STEP <br>TOWARD UNIVERSAL ANTIDOTE FOR SNAKEBITE</b>
			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (May 28, 2014) – A team of researchers, led by Dr. Matthew Lewin of the California Academy of Sciences and Dr. Stephen P. Samuel of Trinity College Dublin, Ireland has taken another promising step toward developing a universal antidote for snakebite. Last summer, the team tested the effectiveness of a nasally administered antiparalytic drug on mice injected with high doses of Indian cobra (<i>Naja naja</i>) venom. Mice injected with otherwise fatal doses of venom outlived and in many cases survived after being treated with the antiparalytic agent, neostigmine. These findings support the team’s idea that providing fast, accessible, and easy-to-administer treatment can increase survival rates in victims of venomous snakebite. The results of this pilot study were recently published in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jtm/2014/131835/" target="_blank"><i>Journal of Tropical Medicine</i></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>During the course of the experiment, separate groups of mice were given varying doses of venom (all above lethal limits) and then treated with the antiparalytic treatment at two different time intervals: within 1-2 minutes after envenomation and 10 minutes after envenomation. 10 of 15 mice given the lowest dose of venom, followed by the treatment within 10 minutes, survived and later exhibited completely normal behavior, while 100 percent of control mice died. In groups given higher doses of cobra venom (2 to 5 times the lethal dose) all mice succumbed, but those treated with a single dose of neostigmine survived significantly longer than the controls. Although the mice in this experiment were each treated only once to maintain a consistent protocol, a nasally administered antidote could, in practice, be administered multiple times without needles. Inhibitors of other types of venom could be combined with those working against paralysis to form a complete antidote. With many combinations for potential testing, the team is now working intensively with chemist and snake venom expert, Dr. Sakthivel Vaiyapuri of Reading University in the United Kingdom, a co-author on the report. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Antivenom is necessary, but not sufficient to manage this problem. Its limitations are fairly well known at this point and we need a better bridge to survival. It’s ironic that virtually every medical organization and practitioner wears the snake symbol, yet we have no real effective treatments for the people getting bitten,” says Dr. Lewin, Director of the Center for Exploration and Travel Health at the Academy. “Ninety-eight percent of snakebite victims live in poverty, which is perhaps why funding and innovation are lacking. The bottom line is that no one should die from a snake bite in the twenty-first century, and we’re optimistic about this promising step.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The team initially demonstrated the potential of this novel snakebite treatment during an experiment conducted in April of 2013 at the University of California, San Francisco. In that experiment, a healthy human volunteer was paralyzed, while awake, using a toxin that mimics the effects of the venom of cobras and other snakes that disable their victims by paralysis. The experimental paralysis progressed from eye muscle weakness to respiratory distress in the same order typically seen in snakebite victims. The team then administered the nasal spray and within 20 minutes the patient had recovered. The results of this experiment were published in the medical journal&nbsp;<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ccr3.3/full" target="_blank"><i>Clinical Case Reports</i></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In late June of 2013, Samuel, Dr. C. Soundara Raj, and colleagues at TCR Multispeciality Hospital in Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu, India accelerated the recovery of a snakebite victim on life support using this method. After receiving 30 vials of antivenom, the standard treatment for venomous snakebites, the female patient remained weak and suffered from facial paralysis. Within 30 minutes of treatment with the antiparalytic nasal spray, the patient’s facial paralysis was reversed. Two weeks after being treated, the patient reported having returned to her daily activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>As the head of the Academy’s Center for Exploration and Travel Health, Lewin prepares field medicine kits for the museum’s scientific expeditions around the world and often accompanies scientists as the expedition doctor. In 2011, Lewin assembled snakebite treatment kits for the Academy’s Hearst Philippine Biodiversity Expedition, which would have required scientists to inject themselves if they were bitten. Lewin began to wonder if there might be an easier way to treat snakebite in the field and began to explore the idea of a quick and easy-to-administer nasal spray. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Snakebite is one of the most neglected of all tropical diseases, with nearly 5 million people bitten by snakes each year. The number of fatalities globally is up to 30 times that of land mines and comparable to AIDS in some developing countries. In India alone, snakes kill approximately a third as many people as AIDS and severely injure many more. It has been estimated that more than 75 percent of snakebite victims who die do so before they ever reach the hospital, predominantly because there is no easy way to treat them in the field. Lewin’s new approach may dramatically reduce the number of global snakebite fatalities, currently estimated to be as high as 94,000 per year.</p>

			</div>
		
			<div id="pr_body"><p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 15, 2014) – The California Academy of Sciences is pleased to announce the appointment of Michelle Trautwein, PhD, as its newest Assistant Curator and Schlinger Chair of Dipterology. In her new role, Trautwein will study the evolution and diversification of insects, particularly flies, through the use of modern phylogenetic and systematic methods and oversee the Academy’s extensive fly collection. She will also continue exploring the rich diversity and evolutionary history of arthropod species that live on and with humans—from face mites to insects in homes. In addition to her research, Trautwein is passionate about public engagement and empowering non-scientists to become active and invested in the scientific process of research and discovery. </p><br><p>“As a museum scientist, I see my role at the Academy as an incredible opportunity and responsibility to get people of all ages informed and excited about the process of doing science,” says Trautwein, the Academy’s newest curator. “I’m looking forward to being able to further my studies in a world-class research institution while expanding its reach as a public museum and biodiversity library.”</p><br><p>Trautwein’s scientific research includes mapping the evolutionary history of flies, by tracing more than 260 million years of genetic evolution to better understand how and when major groups of flies appeared on Earth and how milestones in their evolution, like blood feeding, occurred. Flies account for about 10% of the known life forms on Earth and have a profound impact on human societies—killing more than one million people each year through vector-borne diseases like malaria. Often thought of simply as pests, Trautwein’s research highlights the significant effect these insects have on human society, informing the public about their largely underappreciated benefits as pollinators (of chocolate, for example), decomposers, and model organisms for genetic research. </p><br><p>Trautwein has also developed citizen science projects focused on the arthropods in our daily lives—including “Arthropods in Our Homes,” which aims to explore the diversity of insects commonly found in homes around the world, and “Meet Your Mites,” which aims to unravel the evolutionary history of human face mites. By surveying the species that live with and on us, which she affectionately refers to as “our roommates,” Trautwein’s goal is to better understand how the effects of human behavior impact arthropod evolution. </p><br><p>“Often people have the idea that biodiversity is something that you find only in remote locations in the rainforest or on coral reefs, but the truth is, it's all around us, even in our own homes,” says Trautwein. “I’m interested in studying the evolutionary history of not only organisms that live in remote wildernesses, but also those that live with us and that we interact with every day. I want to know more about how these human-arthropod relationships have developed over time.” </p><br><p>“We’re thrilled to welcome Michelle to the Academy during this time of tremendous growth within our research division,” says Dr. Meg Lowman, Chief of Science and Sustainability at the Academy. “Her passion for empowering the public to explore science is well aligned with our mission to explore and explain life, and her research on insect evolution will contribute to our global efforts to understand and sustain the biodiversity of our planet.” </p><br><p>As an undergraduate, Trautwein originally planned to pursue a career in art, specifically scientific illustration, but was inspired to shift her focus to research during a trip to the coastal rainforests of Costa Rica, where she was mesmerized by the insect diversity that surrounded her. Trautwein finds synergy in both the scientific and artistic process, believing that both fields require and benefit from creative approaches to asking and answering questions about the world. </p><br><p>Prior to joining the Academy, Trautwein served as Assistant Director of the Biodiversity Laboratory at the Nature Research Center at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. She received a degree in biology at the University of Texas and a PhD in Entomology from North Carolina State University, where she has served as an adjunct professor since 2012. Trautwein lives in Tiburon, California with her two children. </p>
